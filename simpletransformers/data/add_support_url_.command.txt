        _:360026686193 <article> "\nWill individuals still be able to see and take action on records in the recycling bin?\nWho can see the recycling bin?  \nHow long are items in the recycling bin? \nWhat happens if someone is in sequence or has a scheduled activity (email, task, etc.) and their record is the one that is deleted based on the Salesforce deletion/merge? \n How many API calls does it take to clean up historical records? \n Are there any ownership \u201cgotchas\u201d if the records being merged are owned by separate users? Does Salesforce \u201cmaster\u201d chosen simply become the new record with existing owner? \n When records are merged in Salesforce, do we update Object ID of the corresponding record in Outreach? Does it just mirror Salesforce? \nWhy is the number of leads / contacts in my Salesforce recycle bin greater than the number of prospects in my Outreach recycle bin? \n\nWill individuals still be able to see and take action on records in the recycling bin?\nWhen an item has been marked as recycled, it will no longer be visible to non-admin Outreach accounts. Admins will only be able to see the records if they filter to show recycled records. Admins can unrecycle (restore) prospects as needed.\nWho can see the recycling bin?  \nVisibility into the recycling bin depends on your governance profile settings. Governance profiles allow you to designate who in your Outreach account should be able to see recycled and undelete recycled prospects and accounts. By default, all non-admin profiles will be denied permission to view and undeleted recycled records. For more information, please review the \"Adjust Governance Profiles\" section of this document.\nHow long are items in the recycling bin? \nIn Salesforce, records are in the recycling bin for 15 days. After 15 days have passed, the records are deleted. The 15 day limit is a Salesforce-side setting that is not configurable in Outreach. However, in Outreach, you do not need to automatically delete prospects or accounts that are placed in the recycling bin. By default, records placed in the recycling bin will live there in perpetuity until manually deleted. However, you also have an org-level setting in Outreach that would enable you to match Salesforce and automatically delete records placed in Outreach\u2019s recycling bin.For more information please review the Salesforce merging section of this document.\nWhat happens if someone is in sequence or has a scheduled activity (email, task, etc.) and their record is the one that is deleted based on the Salesforce deletion/merge?\nThere is an option to ignore prospects that are active in sequence so they will not be recycled. If this setting is not enabled, all prospects will be moved to the recycling bin, including prospects that are paused as a result of an OOTO reply. If a prospect has an active one-off task they will still be recycled, along with the corresponding task.\nThe recycled filter can be combined with other filters, so you will be able to see prospects that are recycled but still have an active sequence state or a stage that indicates they are actively being worked. \nHow many API calls does it take to clean up historical records?\n500 records per 1 API call\nAre there any ownership \u201cgotchas\u201d if the records being merged are owned by separate users? Does Salesforce \u201cmaster\u201d chosen simply become the new record with existing owner?\nIf the Salesforce merge resulted in a new owner, then the owner will be changed and updated in Outreach.\nWhen records are merged in Salesforce, do we update Object ID of the corresponding record in Outreach? Does it just mirror Salesforce?\nThere are three possible scenarios that can answer this question.\n\nIf we have 1:1 mapping with the object ID and the record in Salesforce has been marked for deletion, then we will mark it for deletion in Outreach.\nIf a record is merged in Salesforce and the record Outreach has a mapping for is not the master, Outreach will remap the to the Master record.\nIf there are two Leads in Salesforce that are mapped to two different prospects in Outreach, and the Salesforce Leads are merged together, the object that was merged into will be updated via normal inbound update. The object that was removed though the merge will be permanently deleted and will not be visible in the Outreach recycling bin.\n\nWhy is the number of leads / contacts in my Salesforce recycle bin greater than the number of prospects in my Outreach recycle bin?\nIf you compare the count of your Salesforce recycle bin to the count of your Outreach recycle bin, there will be a discrepancy. There is no need to be alarmed. The merge and delete functionality has worked and you're in good shape. If you need confirmation, you can always check your plugin activity log and the individual prospect activity.\nThere are two reasons why you may see a discrepancy between Outreach and Salesforce:\nScenario 1: You have duplicate Contacts in Salesforce and one prospect in Outreach. You merge the duplicate contacts in Salesforce and the merged contact is mapped to the prospect. In this instance, the prospect in Outreach is automatically associated with the new contact via the master record ID, meaning you will not find it in the recycle bin.\nScenario 2: In this scenario you have two records in Salesforce that are each mapped to an Outreach prospect. If you merge the dupes in Salesforce, the Outreach prospect mapped to the merged Salesforce record will be permanently deleted from Outreach. Don't fret, if you need to resurrect that duplicate you can do so in the Salesforce recycle bin. When inbound polling takes place, the prospect will once again be created in Outreach, assuming it meets the requirements of the Salesforce plugin." .

        _:205022548 <article> "Integration with Gmail is very simple, and is the first step that needs to be taken to start using Outreach. You can choose to connect via REST API (recommended), OAuth 2 (legacy), or with your Gmail login credentials (legacy). \nConnecting Outreach to Gmail through Gmail REST API\n\n Click the initials on the bottom left hand side of Outreach and select \"mailboxes\". \nClick \"edit\" to configure your mailbox. If your mailbox hasn't been set up yet, it will say \"set up account\" instead of \"edit\".\nChoose \"Gmail REST API\" in the Email Provider drop-down menu.\nClick the gray button that says 'Connect with Google', and allow permissions or enter your email credentials. The button will turn blue if successfully connected.\nTurn on toggles for SENDING and SYNCING (they will turn green if successful).\nCopy and paste your signature into the signature field.\nClick Save in the top right.\n\n \nConnect Your Mailbox With Gmail OAuth2\nWe recommend connecting your mailbox using the REST API connection because of the ease and security of the connection, but do give you alternative options. To set up your mailbox using Gmail OAuth2, follow the above instructions, selecting \"Gmail OAuth2\" from the dropdown, instead of Gmail REST API.\nConnect Your Mailbox Using Your Gmail Username & Password\n\nClick the initials on the bottom left hand side of Outreach and select \"mailboxes\". \nClick \"edit\" to configure your mailbox. If your mailbox hasn't been set up yet, it will say \"set up account\" instead of \"edit\".\nChoose \"Gmail\" in the \"Email Provider\" drop-down menu, click on the grey button that says \"change password\", and enter your Gmail password.\nTurn on toggles for SENDING and SYNCING (they will turn green if successful).\nCopy and paste your signature into the signature field.\n\nClick Save in the top right.\n\nWhat does enabling Sending & Syncing Do?\nSending allows Outreach to use your mailbox for email delivery.\nSyncing allows Outreach to talk to your mailbox, so every time you engage with a prospect, we capture information and pull it into Outreach to take the appropriate action.  Are they active in a sequence? If so, Outreach will pull the prospect out of the sequence so they do not continue to receive follow-up emails. Enable the syncing option by clicking on the sync toggle.\nMost Common Error\nIf you connect your mailbox and receive an SMTP error, remove any email and password settings found in the advanced send settings. Depending on your company's Gmail settings, these fields may auto-populate when an OAuth2 token is granted and simply need to be removed to successfully enable sending and syncing. " .

        _:204659768 <article> "In order to import Salesforce data into Outreach or vice versa, Outreach utilizes a bi-directional syncing method. Outreach users can sync updated information on any field within Salesforce or Outreach and create new records from either platform.\nOutreach utilizes an OAuth connection to sync data between both platforms. When setting up Outreach for the first time, all configuration will be done within Outreach. Outreach is not an APEX application.\nWe are compatible with Salesforce Lightning, Salesforce Aloha (\"Classic\"),  Salesforce Console, and the SKUID overlay.\nOutreach & Salesforce Bi-Directional Sync\nWhile competing companies claim to have a bi-directional database sync, most do not. Outreach has invested significant resources into creating a proper enterprise-grade, bi-directional sync that allows users to bring data from any record or field, and then update that data back to Salesforce. For additional information on our bi-directional sync capabilities, see Data Transfer Capability.\nOutreach pulls down new records and updates every 10 minutes as a default, but can be configured to pull this information even faster. When pushing new data to Salesforce, Outreach waits 60 seconds before sending an update to ensure multiple different updates are combined into one package, preventing unnecessary API calls.\nConnection Requirements\nThere are a few Connection Requirements to leverage the Salesforce connection within Outreach.\nCommon Use Cases\nOutreach's connection to Salesforce is used to create and update records in either platform and then sync the two platforms to mirror each other. Users have the option of using Outreach or Salesforce as their front end application, depending on their unique workflow. They can also leverage the connection for both inbound and outbound actions, along with more tactical communication with leads, contacts, and accounts. \nPre-connection Decisions\nThere are two important questions that need to be answered before having your initial call with an Outreach Account Manager.\n\nWhat records need to be brought into Outreach? Should the records feed in automatically if the specified criteria were met, do users want to manually pull specific lists in or should both be available?\nAre lead and contact statuses finalized? Ensure leads and contact fields are set up correctly and completed in order for Outreach to match the leads and contacts correctly. See Configure Your Lead/Contact Statuses.\n\n " .

        _:115001595587 <article> "As you prepare to connect Outreach to your Salesforce account, there are a few terms that are important to understand. These toggles are found under each object (lead, contact, account, etc.) in the plugin configuration settings. We've defined these settings below so you can configure your plugin in whichever way suits your workflow best!\nPolling\nThe polling function allows for Outreach to automatically scan Salesforce for any newly created objects or changes to existing objects in Salesforce. Outreach will only notice a recently updated object if the change occurred to a mapped field. \nExample: Let's say you have the first name, last name, and email address mapped on the lead object in the plugin. If the lead's last name updates in Salesforce, Outreach would notice this change and attempt an inbound update, assuming the Inbound Update toggle is enabled (explained below). If the lead's phone number was updated, Outreach would not notice that change, since the phone number field is not mapped on the lead.\nPolling Frequency\nThe polling frequency determines how often we poll Salesforce for new and/or updated objects (see the polling feature described above).\nNote: If you increase the time between polling cycles, less API calls will be used.\nPushing\nThe pushing function will automatically push changes that occur in Outreach to Salesforce, assuming the change takes place on a mapped field. This toggle will also allow newly created objects in Outreach to push to Salesforce, assuming Outbound Create is enabled (explained below).\nExample: Let's say you have the Outbound Create toggle enabled for contacts. If a new contact is created in Outreach, and the pushing toggle is enabled, that contact would be created automatically in Salesforce, assuming it passes all of the validation rules for contacts.\nInbound Create\nThis function will create records in Outreach from Salesforce. \nExample: If you have the polling (explained above) and inbound create toggles enabled on the account object, and a record is updated or created in Salesforce, a new account record will be created in Outreach. \nInbound Update\nThis function allows records to update inbound from Salesforce to Outreach.\nExample: If you have the address mapped on the account object and their address changes in Salesforce, the address will update inbound. This assumes the polling toggle is enabled and there is an existing mapped account in Outreach. \nOutbound Create\nThis function allows records to be created from Outreach to Salesforce.\nExample: If a prospect is created in Outreach and the outbound create and pushing toggles are enabled on the lead object, a new lead will be created in Salesforce. This assumes the lead passes all validation rules in Salesforce. \nOutbound Update\nThis function allows records to update from Outreach to Salesforce.\nNOTE: Only fields that are mapped in the 'fields' section of the plugin will be pushed up to Salesforce. \nMessages & Events\nThese are the activity postings that will be pushed up to salesforce after emails are delivered/received, tasks are completed, calls are made, or opens/clicks occur on any email deliveries. These can be customized by clicking on the gear icon to the right of each specific function. Keep in mind that each of these toggles uses 1 API call each time a message or event is pushed to Salesforce." .

When you click into the plugin, you'll see the following tabs on the top of the page: Types, Limits, Settings, Activity, and Logs.   \nTypes\nThe Types tab shows the different objects within Salesforce and the different options available to connect to those objects. The options that are chosen control the flow of data between Outreach and Salesforce for those objects.\n Limits\nThe Limits tab allows an Administrator to set limits on how many API calls Outreach is allowed to make on a given day. The API calls available are designated by Salesforce and if you need additional API calls, we recommend reaching out to your SFDC representative. \n\nGlobal API call usage is the number of API calls used by all applications connected to Salesforce that require API calls. \nOutreach-specific API call usage breaks down the Global API call usage to show you how many API calls Outreach is using. \nIn the above example, of the 2973 total API calls used by all platforms connected to Salesforce, 164 of those API calls have come from Outreach.\nSettings\nThe Settings tab shows a toggle for the setting labeled \"Refresh users on reconnect.\" When enabled, this setting causes all users (active or not) to sync upon reconnecting the plugin in Outreach.

        _:115003566233 <article> "Sales reps need LinkedIn to get important details about a prospect when they\u2019re selling. We\u2019re excited to share that we have partnered with LinkedIn to integrate Outreach with LinkedIn Sales Navigator to help Outreach users better connect with prospects without leaving the Outreach workflow.\nOur integration with the LinkedIn Sales Navigator Application Platform allows you to enhance your Outreach experience with the rich social data in Sales Navigator. This partnership allows you to access your LinkedIn Sales Navigator information where you\u2019re already selling.\nFor those of our users who have LinkedIn Sales Navigator accounts, we will provide access to the most important Linkedin Information distilled into \"tiles\" to utilize on our Prospect and Account overview dashboards. These tiles will surface relevant data including work history, common connections, and LinkedIn activity.  \nGetting Set Up\nAll Outreach users with a Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise license will have access to two LinkedIn Sales Navigator tiles (One for Sales Navigator Lead, and one for Sales Navigator Account) within the intelligence tile menu.\n\nNavigate to the prospect or account list from the left hand navigation and click into a prospect or account. This will land you in the \"overview\" tab, which is the landing page for our Sales Intelligence Tiles.\nTo add a new Sales Navigator tile, click \"Edit\" on the dropdown next to the layout picker and \"Modify Layout\". Note: If you don't see the option to edit, you will first need to clone a layout, then set it as your default, and try again.\nClick \"Add New Tile\" and from the Tile Store, scroll to select the available LinkedIn Tiles* (they'll appear at the bottom of the list). The Tiles will disappear from the Tile Store when added to your dashboard.\nExit out of the Tile Store to return to the dashboard.\nYou can adjust the size of the tiles by clicking on the corning of the tile and dragging it until you've reached your preferred size. Tiles can also be rearranged by clicking and dragging the tile to the preferred area of the dashboard. Make sure you save your changes.If you are not logged into Sales Navigator, the tile(s) will have default text with a link to the sign in page. Click on the link to open a separate tab and log into Sales Navigator**. Refresh your Outreach screen to see the tile data light up. \n\n*On the prospect level both the Sales Navigator Lead and Account tiles are available. When adding Tiles to the Account dashboard, only the Sales Navigator Account tile is available.\n**You do not need to have the same email address for your LinkedIn account as your Outreach account. Make sure you log into Sales Navigator with the email address attached to your LinkedIn account. For some, this may be a personal email address.\n " .

        _:221467927 <article> "CSV files are a reliable way to import a list of prospect (Contact or Lead) records into Outreach. A CSV is a \"comma separated values\" file, which allows data to be saved in a table structured format, similar to Excel files (.xls). CSVs look like a garden-variety spreadsheet but with a .csv extension.\nTo create a CSV file from an Excel file, choose the Save As option and change the file type to .csv - Comma Separated Values. Outreach cannot import Excel files.\nWhat if the prospect already exists in Outreach?\nOutreach will automatically dedupe all prospects based on their email address. If email address is not included in the CSV file, Outreach can instead use either a Github or Twitter Username as a unique identifier.\nImport a CSV file into Outreach\n\nClick the \"Quick Action\" or the lighting icon in the upper right hand corner and choose \"Bulk Create\"\nSelect your file and click the Next button on the top right corner.\nMap the columns of your CSV to corresponding fields in Outreach Example: \"First Name\" field in Outreach is mapped to the \"First Name\" column in the CSV file.  The owner will default to the individual importing the prospect. To set a new owner,  map the Outreach User ID to the Owner ID on this step of the import \n\n\nClick next and on the third import screen select an owner for all the records in the CSV. You will have have the following options:\n\nDecide what to do with duplicates. Update Missing Fields will update only fields on the prospect that are not already present. Overwrite Existing Fields will replace existing information on the prospect with the information contained in the spreadsheet (overwritten fields only apply to fields  mapped in the second step of the import). Skip will skip updating information on prospects that already exist in Outreach.\nAdd a stage to the list of prospects (optional)\nAdd a timezone that will apply to the list of prospects (optional)\nAdd tags to the list of records to easily find and group them together (optional)\nLoad additional data from Salesforce to sync the prospects with the corresponding lead/contact in Salesforce.\n\n\nClick \"Next\" and \"Start Import\" when you're ready. \n\n*Note: We do not support UTF-8 files and special characters." .

To speed up this process, you have the option to import accounts through a CSV file and assign prospects to these accounts.\nImport accounts\n\nClick on the quick actions menu to bulk create. You\u2019ll be brought to a new page with a dropdown menu.

This field should be an id that\u2019s unique to the account, so that only net new accounts are created by Outreach. The Custom ID field will be used to dedupe accounts upon import. If you do not include the custom ID, Outreach will fall back to dedupe by Account name.Note: If you include an incomplete custom ID row (a custom ID is missing from one of your accounts), you'll receive an error message telling you that the row with the missing custom ID will not be imported.\n\n " .

        _:115001646653 <article> "While creating templates in Outreach, you have the option to track the amount of times a prospect has opened your email and to track how many times they have clicked on links. \nUnderstanding Open Tracking\nOutreach will track every time an email is opened when this setting is enabled. It is always defaulted to on.\n\nOpen tracking uses an invisible tracking pixel in your emails. Each time an email is opened, this pixel is downloaded, and Outreach knows a prospect has opened an email. This is true if the email is opened by the same person multiple times or if the recipient forwards the email and the new recipients open the email.\nIf an email has not been opened, the eyeball icon in your Outbox will be greyed out. If an email has been opened once, this icon will turn blue. If it\u2019s opened multiple times, you will see a red number appear above the eyeball icon.\n\n\n\nEnabling & Disabling Open Tracking\nOpen tracking can be enabled in the content window when creating templates and snippets.\n\nCreate a new template by clicking on the \"Quick Actions\" bar on the top of the page, or when composing a single email.\nCompose your email and, on the bottom of the compose window, open tracking will be automatically enabled. You'll know open tracking is enabled if the eye icon is highlighted red. You can disable open tracking by clicking on the eye icon. The icon will turn grey.\n\nOpen Tracking in Sequence Emails\nIn sequence email steps using a pre-created template, Outreach will pull in the open tracking setting that was applied when the template was created. Changing the sequence email step will not impact the default setting applied to the template.\nIf you are not using a template, or building off of a snippet, you can still enable and disable open tracking. \n \n " .

        _:360009701434 <article> "Outreach makes it easy to gain actionable insights at a glance. The Team Performance Dashboard provides an intuitive, and comprehensive reporting dashboard for managers and reps to view their team and individual top line performance metrics. Managers can identify the health of the business and performance gaps between reps, to better determine which actions to double down on or which reps need more coaching. Individual reps can measure their performance in the same lens of their managers, making conversation more engaging, actionable, and transparent.\nThe team dashboard includes two tiles: \u201cWhat activities has my team completed?\u201d and \u201cWhich sequences lead to booked meetings?\u201d.\n\u201cWhat activities has my team completed\u201d\nThis chart shows a list of activities that the team has completed. On the top of the chart, you have the option to filter by all activities, calls, and/or emails. \n Next to the activity filter is the date filter. With the date filter, you can filter activities by a few preset options: yesterday, today, last week, this week, last month, or this month.\nFinally, you can sort the chart by different groups of users. These options include: you, everyone, specific users, or specific teams.\nOn the far right hand side of the chart, you have the option to download the chart data.\n Each column header has a sorting option. If, for example, you want to sort by who has the most overdue tasks, you\u2019d click on the \u201coverdue tasks\u201d header to sort the field in ascending or descending order.\nUnderstanding the Activity Metrics\nMost metrics have a tool tip that you can hover over for more information:\n\nActivities Tile\n\nEmail - Count of mailings delivered within the specified time period by the individual\nOther Tasks - All other type of tasks completed within the specified time period\n\n\nSequences Tile\n\nOpen rate - Sum of all opens / sum of all deliveries\nClick rate - Sum of all clicks / sum of all deliveries\nReply rate -  Sum of all replies / sum of all deliveries\n\n\n\nEmails Tab\n\nDelivered - Number of outbound emails sent and successfully delivered over time by the individual\nOpen rate - Sum of all opens / sum of all deliveries\nReply rate - Sum of all replies / sum of all deliveries \nClick rate - Sum of all clicks / sum of all deliveries\n\nCalls Tab\n\nAttempted - Number of outbound calls made\nConnected - Number of outbound calls that hit a voicemail or picked up by an individual.\n\nFAQ\nAt what point is a prospect considered \"active\"?\nIf a prospect is active in at least one sequence.\nWhat is considered an \"active\" account?\nA minimum number of 1 active prospects will produce 1 active account.\nWhat is the timeframe for prospects to be considered \"added\" to the sequence?\nThis calculation is based on the time filter. For example, if you have the report filtered by \"week,\" you would see prospects added to a sequence over the past week, that were not previously added to a sequence prior to the filter's constraints.\nAre pending prospects considered \"added\" or do they need to be active in the first step of the sequence?\nProspects need to be active in the sequence. Pending prospects are not included because they have not yet been added to the first step of the sequence\nDo we only count calls where there was a connection (someone picked up)? Or do we count all call attempts even if there was no answer and no voicemail left?\nThe number on the \"all activities\" tile of the Team Performance Dashboard shows attempts. Within the call insights view, we show attempts and connections. Connections are reported as calls > 1m in duration.\nDo we count it if a voicemail was left?\nWe only look at duration, not events. If the call duration is > 1 minute, we make a connection.\n\u201cWhich sequences lead to booked meetings?\u201d\nThis chart shows a list of all sequences, breaking down information by the number of meetings booked through Outreach that can be attributed to a sequence (more information below). In addition, the chart includes data on the open rate, click rate, and reply rate of the sequences.\nSimilar to the activity chart, you have the option to sort each column header. If, for example, you want to view sequences with the highest reply rates, you can click on the \u201creply rate\u201d header to sort the field in ascending or descending order.\nUnderstanding the Sequence Booked Metrics\n\nBooked meetings -  Number of prospects who have booked a meeting while active in a sequence or recently completed in a sequence.\nOpen rate - Sum of all opens / sum of all deliveries\nClick rate - Sum of all clicks / sum of all deliveries\nReply rate -  Sum of all replies / sum of all deliveries \n\nFor example, sequence A has 4 email steps. All 4 emails are delivered, but there are only 2 opens, 1 click, 0 replies. This would produce the following:\n\nOpen \u2192 50%\nClicks \u2192 25%\nReplies \u2192 0%\n\nFAQ\nAre we limiting attribution to meetings booked if the last touch was over x days/weeks/months ago?\nYes, the meeting booking attribution logic only applies to sequences the prospect has been active in within the last 30 days.\nHow does a booked meeting get associated to a sequence? Is it based off time? Do we have a time limit in place? \nIf the meeting is booked while a prospect is in a sequence, we will attribute the booked meeting to that sequence. If a meeting is booked and the prospect is not active in a sequence, we will look at the last sequence they were in within 30 days and apply a last touch attribution method, attributing the booked meeting to the last touched sequence. The meeting does not need to be accepted by the prospect to count as being booked.\nDoes it only include meetings booked through Outreach Meetings? Or does it include any meeting booked with a prospect (sync in through gcal or outlook cal)?\n Both Outreach meetings and synced calendars\n " .

This article provides direction to users in setting up their Outreach Voice options. \nNote: Review the Network Requirements for IT Admins and Network Engineers article prior to completing this process. \nAdd an Outreach Phone Number\n\nAccess the Outreach Platform.\nClick the user's initials in the bottom left-hand corner of the navigation sidebar. \nOn the Settings landing page, click Voice in the menu bar. \nOn the Voice Settings landing page, configure your Voice settings as applicable. \n\n\nMy Outreach Phone Numbers\nOutreach provides you with three options when configuring your phone numbers. \nProspect's Local Number\n\nSelect this option to enable a number with the Prospect's local area code to appear in their caller ID when you call. If an area code matching the Prospect's cannot be found, Outreach uses an area code near the Prospect's location. \nNote: Each time you dial a Prospect with a new area code, a new number is added to your account. Each new number incurs an additional charge. For more information on regarding pricing, refer to the Outreach Voice Pricing article. \nFor more information on the local dial feature, refer to the Enable Local Dial article. \nPurchase a Number\nSelect this option to purchase a new number to appear in the caller ID when calling Prospects. \n\nNote: This number cannot be a number you already own and use. For more information on configuring a Purchased Number, refer to the Setting Up Voice: Add an Outreach Number article. \nImport a Number\nSelect this option to import a number you already own and would like to use. This number will appear on the Prospect's caller ID when you call. \n\nFor more information on custom caller ID, refer to the Custom Caller ID: Import a Phone Number Into Outreach article. \nAfter you successfully configured your phone number options, your default number appears in the My Outreach Phone Numbers section. \n\nSelect the Device You Want to Call From\nOutreach provides you with two options for calling Prospects: Computer or Phone. \n\nSelecting the Computer option allows you to utilize your internet and computer to call Prospects. Though this option is more affordable, you are at the mercy of your internet connection; therefore, if you're working with a weak wireless signal, or a low-bandwidth connection, calls could be dropped due to high-volume traffic or connection degradation. \nSelecting the Phone option allows you operate on the standard Telco lines (or mobile provider as applicable). Though possibly more reliable than a computer-based option, rates could vary. \nFor more information regarding the pros and cons of computer vs. phone calling options, refer to the Computer v. Phone Calling article. \nSelecting Both requires an imported number and a computer-based dialing method. When receiving an incoming call, the call will ring both on your preferred number and your computer within Outreach, allowing you to answer the call on either device. \nNote: When using this option, unanswered calls connect to your preferred number's voicemail and you will not be able to set up a voicemail greeting in Outreach as the call routes to your preferred number's voicemail system. \nEnabling the Keep Your Phone Connected Between Calls option will keep the call connected to your preferred number after the Prospect disconnects, and connect to the next Prospect you dial over the same connection to save time in setting up new calls. \n " .

It could also mean that the daily throttle limit has been reached or there is no delivery window open in the assigned schedule.\nPaused: this means that the user has manually paused the prospect within the sequence, they will remain in the sequence until they're 'resumed'\nPaused OOTO: this means that a mailing was sent to a prospect and an Out of the Office reply was received. They will remain paused until they are manually resumed, unless the sequence settings are enabled to automatically resume ooto prospects.\nDisabled: this means the sequence as whole has been disabled, a sequence step has been disabled, or a sequence step does not have an assigned template.\nFailed: this means that the mailing failed to send. If you hovers your mouse over the failed label, the reason for why it failed will be given.\nBounced: if you click into the prospect's profile and find the bounce message in the activity feed, the bounce reason that was provided by the prospect's email service provider will be shown. If you hover over the red \"bounced\" label, you'll see the date and time the prospect bounced.\nFinished (Replied): this means the prospect replied to a mailing and has been removed from the sequence.\nFinished (No Reply): this means the prospect received all steps in the sequence and has been removed without replying.\nOpted-Out: this means the prospect has selected the unsubscribe link to opt out of mailings in the future.\n\nIn Outreach, prospects are considered active in a sequence unless they are in the Finished (replied), Finished (No Reply), or Opted-Out state. \nThese sequence states will be automatically assigned by Outreach however, you can manually assign these to the prospect from within the sequence too:\n" .

        _:360015326194 <header> "The Drift & Outreach Integration" .
        _:360015326194 <article> "Drive real-time conversations with your Outreach sequences! When a prospect clicks any link to your website in your Outreach sequence, they\u2019ll be greeted with a personalized message from their sales rep. If that rep isn\u2019t around, no problem \u2013 a bot can jump in and book a meeting for them.\nThere are two sides to the integration:\n\nDrive Real-Time Conversations With Your Outreach Sequences\nAutomatically Follow Up With Prospects You Chat With In Drift\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll explain how to enable the integration, how #1 works, and best practices for using the integration.\nFor more information on #2, visit Drift\u2019s support documentation to see how to enroll a Drift lead into an Outreach sequence. \nNote:  You need the same admin on both platforms (Drift & Outreach) to enable the integration, the integration only works for users with licenses to both platforms, and adding the Drift integration is an org-wide action rather than a personal one for just one rep\u2019s account.\nScreen Recording 2019-01-07 at 02.23 PM.mov\nEnabling the Integration\nNavigate to your Org settings, look for the Drift integration, and click \u201cLearn More\u201d to be directed to the Drift integration installation page.\n\nNote: If the integration has already been enabled, you can always come back to this page to manage the Drift app\u2019s settings. Instead of seeing the \u201cLearn More\u201d button, you\u2019ll instead see a button that\u2019s labeled \u201cManage App\u201d.\n\nWhen you click on the \u201cLearn More\u201d button, you\u2019re sharing the the details of Outreach\u2019s side of the integration. Click \u201cInstall\u201d to install the app.\n\nWhen you click install, you\u2019ll see a box from Drift asking for access to your Outreach account. For the integration to work, Outreach needs to send some of the prospect and sender data. With this information, Drift can recognize Outreach prospects when they\u2019re directed to Drift from an Outreach sequence link.\n\nTo ensure the same rep who sent the Outreach sequence is also the rep on the Drift chat, Drift needs to know who the Outreach user is so it can personalize the chat message for the prospect. Click \u201cAuthorize App\u201d to give Outreach permission to send this info to Drift, and to receive the information from the conversation driven from your Outreach sequence.\n\nYou\u2019ve successfully connected your Drift account to Outreach! There are three pieces to the next step:\n\nBy default, all links within your sequences will now send certain information to Drift. If Drift can find a match of the user (Sally Rep who sends the email also has a Drift account she uses to chat with prospects), the Drift chatbot on your website will greet the prospect with Sally\u2019s picture and greeting. If you choose to only have certain links on your website connect between Outreach and Drift, you can designate them in the blank box.\nWhen a prospect is directed to Drift from your Outreach sequence link, if they don\u2019t engage with the chatbot, nothing happens to your sequence. But if they send a message, a \u201cNew Conversation\u201d will post in that prospect\u2019s activity feed in Outreach. Each Drift chat message - from the prospect or from the rep - will then be posted as a line in your activity feed. If there is too much Drift activity clogging up your activity feed, we\u2019d suggest unchecking \u201cInbound Messages\u201d and \u201cOutbound Messages\u201d so each individual message doesn\u2019t post to Outreach. A URL of the full transcript of the chat can be found on the \u201cNew Conversation\u201d event.  \nAfter a prospect engages with you on your Drift chat, they will by default remain in the sequence that drove them there. To ensure that prospect\u2019s next step is contextual, you can trigger custom actions within Outreach so they don\u2019t continue in their current sequence unless desired. We recommend setting up a new trigger immediately to designate what should happen when one of the events stated in #2 occurs.\n\nFinally, you need to turn on your Outbound Playbook in Drift. When a prospect lands on the webpage they will see the Outbound Playbook, as long as it is turned on. \nYou\u2019ve now connected the integration for #1. To enable #2, you need to connect Outreach to Drift. Do so by clicking the green button \u201cConnect Outreach to Drift.\u201d\n\nYou can also click the green icon in your Drift settings to connect Outreach. You\u2019re enabling Drift to see all available Outreach sequences (your private sequences and sequences that have been shared with you) and enroll leads/prospects into them directly from Drift.\n\nClick \u201cAuthorize\u201d for Drift to be able to create prospects, import sequences, add to sequence, send emails from your inbox, and perform any other necessary operations within Outreach.\n\nNow you\u2019ve completed connecting Outreach & Drift for use cases #1 and #2.\n\nDrive Real-Time Conversations With All Of Your Outreach Sequences\nWhen a prospect clicks a link in your email, they\u2019ll be redirected to the associated web page. With the Outreach + Drift integration enabled, a personalized chatbot will fire with the associated rep\u2019s name and/or picture (assuming the Outreach rep who sent the email also uses Drift to engage with prospects).\n\nIf the prospect doesn\u2019t engage with the chatbot, the sequence keeps moving forward unaffected.\nIf the prospect engages with the chatbot, their email is captured automatically, the chat activity will be posted in Outreach (based on the settings you enabled earlier), and you can determine how you want the sequence to respond (based on the triggers you set up earlier).\n\nDrift events are posted in the Outreach activity feed.\n\nMake sure you\u2019ve set your filters to include events from external parties. If Drift events are clogging up your activity feed, you can always update your Drift settings to limit what types of Drift events you want posted in your feed.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you\u2019ve enabled the integration on both ends, what do I need to do?\nShort answer: nothing! Your sequence links don\u2019t need updating. We\u2019ll automatically send prospect info to Drift when links are clicked and directed to your website where Drift is enabled and there is a match between the Outreach and Drift user. Drift will post chat events to the Outreach activity feed. Once the app is installed, an email notification will be sent to all Outreach admins on your account.\nLong answer:\n\nNow that you can put unconverted website leads into Outreach sequences, you should create sequences specifically meant to follow up with those leads. For example, if a lead goes to your pricing page, has questions about pricing but doesn\u2019t book a meeting right then, create a \u201cPricing Follow-Up Sequence.\u201d\nRethink your sequence strategy to not only optimize for replies, but to drive people to your website so you can have a live chat with hot, high-quality prospects. \nIf you haven\u2019t already, set up your triggers. When a prospect is driven from your sequence to a website chat, by default, that prospect will remain in sequence. Triggers allow you to customize what happens to that prospect in Outreach after the chat finishes so the next step is contextual.\n\nAutomatically Follow Up With Prospects You Chat With In Drift\nNow when you\u2019re chatting with a prospect in Drift, you can immediately enroll them in an Outreach sequence. That way, you\u2019ll never forget to follow up. You can learn more here, but the quick version is outlined below.\nTake Action on Prospects that Engage with Drift\nWhen a Drift chat occurs, you can trigger custom actions within Outreach off of the Drift events to ensure that after prospects chat with you on Drift, they don't continue in their current sequence (unless desired). We recommend setting up triggers immediately. You'll notice a new trigger - 'Mark Related Sequences Finish For Prospect.' This trigger allows you to only stop the sequence that drove the prospect to your Drift chat.\nNote: You will not see the trigger settings until you have set up the integration in both Drift and Outreach. You must also have admin access in Outreach to create triggers.\n\nIn Outreach, click on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach platform.\nUnder the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d select \u201cTriggers\u201d\nOn the top right hand side of the trigger list view page, select the blue \u201cAdd\u201d Button\nName your trigger. We recommend making it descriptive so that you can quickly glance at the name and understand what the trigger is accomplishing.\nUnder the Event section, you have three options. We'd highly recommend only triggering off of the \"Drift - New Conversation\" event as it only occurs once a prospect engages with your chat. Triggering off of the specific messages creates far more noise than one trigger based on the conversation simply being initiated. \n\nDrift - New Conversation: only occurs when a prospect is driven to a Drift chat from a sequence link and engages with the chat (meaning they have to type something and send it)\nDrift - Inbound Message: message sent by the prospect in the Drift chat\nDrift - Outbound Message: message sent by the rep in the Drift Chat \n\nIn the \u201cProspect Conditions\u201d section, add conditions on the prospect that must be met for the trigger to fire. You also have the option to add account conditions.\nUnder trigger actions, decide what should be done when the Drift event occurs and the prospect and/or account conditions are met.\nSave your changes and return to the trigger overview page and activate your sequence by clicking on the toggle next to the sequence game so that it turns green.\n\nMost customers utilize the following triggers (make sure you activate it once finished):\nEvent: Drift - New Conversation\nTarget: Prospect\nProspect Conditions: Id (Outreach Internal), Is Not, Empty\nTrigger Action (#1): Action - Stop Sequences, Scope - Mark Related Sequences Finished For Prospect\nTrigger Action (#2): Action - Create Task, Task: Action Item, Priority: High, Time Between Event And When Task Is Due: 0 Minutes, Task Note: Decide how to follow-up with the prospect after their Drift conversation\nTrigger Action (#3): Action - Add Tags, Tags: DriftChat\nTrigger Action (#4): Action - Set Field, Field Name: Stage, Field Value: Replied\nAdd Contacts to an Outreach Sequence from Drift\nWithin your Drift contact list, you can select a Drift contact then click \u201cEnroll in Sequence.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll then be able to view all of your own private sequences or any sequences you have permission to view and use (respecting your governance settings), and enroll the prospect into a sequence directly from Drift.\n\nFAQs\nWhat happens if a prospect clicks a link when I\u2019m out of office? \nWhatever out of office or routing rules you have in place in your Drift settings will function as always.\nMy inbound reps use Drift & Outreach. But what happens to all the links of Outreach users who don\u2019t use Drift?\nNothing different than before the integration. Your prospects will be directed to whatever link they click, and your Drift settings will function as they always have. The chat message simply won\u2019t be personalized and you won\u2019t be able to identify the prospect from the sequence link. \nHow do I set up triggers of my Drift events?\nSee our support docs for triggers here.\n" .

        _:219124908 <article> "Outreach comes with many standard fields to accommodate your Outreach-Salesforce field configuration, but we know it's important that your field mapping is custom to your company. With custom fields, you can create exactly the fields you need to hold the information that's most important about your prospects and accounts. In essence, custom fields help accommodate non-standard fields in Salesforce that you want to use in Outreach. For example, you can use custom fields as dynamic tags for email templates.\nOutreach defaults every user to 35 prospect custom fields and 35 account custom fields, but more can be added to your account if requested.\n Prospect Custom Fields\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of Outreach\nUnder \"System Config\" select \"Prospects\"\nYou'll see a list of custom fields where you can create labels, which will help you identify what information is being pulled into Outreach from Salesforce. \n\n\n \nAccount Custom Fields\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of Outreach\nUnder the settings panel, find the section labeled \"Accounts\"\nYou'll see a list of custom fields where you can create labels, which will help you identify what information is being pulled into Outreach from Salesforce. \n\n\nOn both the prospect and account you are able to add a custom field label or modify an existing one.  Once a custom field label has been entered and saved, that field will be available in the prospect and account settings and wherever custom fields are applicable.\nNaming your custom fields is helpful to keep everything linear across the whole org and ensure people are importing the correct information into the correct custom fields. This also allows them to show up as a named field on the prospect level an within the Salesforce plugin field mappings on the lead and the contact objects. \nOutreach Custom fields are limited to 30k characters. \nCustom Fields Use Cases\nTemplates\nTemplates allow you to include the custom field information as an auto populating variable.\nWhen creating a template, click on the variable icon at the bottom of the compose window.  Select from the list of variables to choose from.  Variables labeled {{CustomX}}, with X being numbers 1-30, are your custom variables set up in settings.  The double brackets on the left show you which number variable it is, while on the right displays the content for that variable.  \nIn the example below, the custom variable #1 is \u201cshoe size.\u201d  Notice how the email is formatted as a template, and the dynamic preview to the right.\n \nTriggers\nCustom fields can be used to create triggers, automated actions taken by Outreach based on specified conditions.\nUnder settings > triggers > +add > edit trigger, you\u2019re able to add one of your custom fields to the prospect conditions.  \n\nPlugins\nCustom fields are extremely useful if your Salesforce instance has a lot of information that is necessary for prospect engagement. You can map the custom fields to those fields in your SFDC and bring that information into Outreach. Once in Outreach you can sort, filter, and segment prospects using that information so that prospects get the most targeting messaging for their persona. Or, you can use those custom fields in templates or sequences. Say you've generated a custom URL or code for use across a specific group of prospects. You can designate a custom field for that and direct them to a page specifically for them using the custom field in as a variable. i.e. Outreach.com/{{custom15}}. " .

        _:115001092234 <article> "Branded URLs allow you to personalize your public calendar link, unsubscribe link, open, and click tracking links and can improve your spam score by putting these services under a domain that matches your brand.  Setting this up will require access to your DNS provider.  If you're not sure who this is, you can check with the company that you purchased your domain name from.\nSetting up Branded URLs\n\nDecide on the domain you want Outreach to use for your unsubscribe, open and click tracking links.  For example, if your main website is at http://mycompany.com, you might choose hello.mycompany.com.  Note: We do not recommend using \"Outreach\" as a part of the domain name.\nAdd the CNAME record mapping this domain to Outreach.\n\nTo find the record you need to add, navigate to Settings > Branded URLs.  This is an Admin setting and you will not see it if you don't have admin privileges.\nIf you haven't set up a branded URL yet, you'll see the default Outreach domain already in use. Click on the Add button in the top right.\nYou'll see the New Branded URL dialog appear.  Make note of the value in the blue box; you'll need this to complete this step.\n\n\n\n\nYou'll then need to add a CNAME record to your DNS entries for this domain.  The process for doing this will vary depending on your DNS provider.  Here are the details of the records you need to add:\n\n\n\n\nSubdomain\nRecord Type\nValue\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nYou can see instructions for adding a CNAME record at various DNS providers here:\n\nGoDaddy: https://www.godaddy.com/help/add-a-cname-record-19236\nNamecheap: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9646/10/\nGoogle Domains: https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290350?hl=en&ref_topic=3251230\nAmazon Route 53: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-editing.html\n\nDepending on your DNS provider, the record may take up to 20 minutes to be created on their servers.\n\n\n\nSubdomain\nRecord Type\nValue\nTTL\n\n\nSubdomain chosen in step 1 [eg. sales.mycompany.com]\nCNAME\n[value obtained from Outreach]\nDefault/Automatic\n\n\n\n \n3. Add the domain to the \"New Branded URL\" dialog and click Save.  Make sure to enter just the domain (sales.mycompany.com) and not the full address (http://sales.mycompany.com).\n\n\nThe new domain will appear in the list in \"Pending\" status.  Please wait a few minutes and refresh the page.  It can take anywhere from an additional few minutes to 24 hours for the DNS change to fully propagate, depending on your DNS provider.\nWhen the \"Pending\" status changes to \"Active\", the Branded URL is live!  \nIf your Branded URL is \"queued\", it suggests that it is waiting for a certificate creation. If the Branded URL is in this state for over 24 hours, please reach out to support@outreach.io.\n\n\nAll unsubscribe, email open, and click tracking links delivered from Outreach will now contain your branded URLs." .

        _:206297197 <article> "Outreach performs a bi-directional sync on Lead and Contact statuses. Your Outreach account comes with the following set of sample stages, which map to Lead or Contact Statuses:\n\nNew\nApproaching\nReplied\nUnresponsive\nDo Not Contact\nBad Data\n\nThe stages above are included as best practice examples. For instance, if you want to set a Lead status as \"New\", other individuals using Outreach would know that the Lead has not been touched. If the status was set to \"Approaching\", others would know that someone is in communication with the Lead. \nIf you want to track records at a more detailed level than what is provided as a boiler plate, Outreach admins can make adjustments. Once the stages have been added, removed or modified within Outreach, the stages can be mapped 1:1 to the lead or contact statuses. The steps are outlined below.\nMapping Prospect Stages in Outreach\nBefore configuring your Lead and Contact statuses in the Salesforce plugin, you need to add the lead and contact statuses that exist in Salesforce to the stage options in Outreach.\n\nIf you are the Outreach admin, click on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach Platform. On the settings panel, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Prospect\".\nOn the top of the page, Select \"Stages\" and remove any stages that are not needed.\nAdd stages as they appear in Salesforce. These need to be mapped 1:1, including spacing and capitalization to ensure proper sync between Outreach and Salesforce. For example, if you have the status 'OPEN' in Outreach, you need to have the same status 'OPEN' in Salesforce.\nOnce you have configured your Outreach Stages, the next step is  to map them 1:1 in the Salesforce plugin.\n\nMapping Lead Statuses\n\nIf you are the Outreach admin, click on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach Platform. On the settings panel, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Plugins\".\nOn the top of the page, select \"Types\" and then click into \"Lead Statuses\".\nOn the top of the page, Click in the \"Mappings\" tab and on the top right corner, \"Add\" new lead status mappings.\nContinue to add the mappings until all Salesforce statuses exist in the plugin.\nReturn to the main page of the Salesforce plugin by clicking on \"the breadcrumbs on the top of the page. Click into the \"Lead\" object type and on the top of the page click on \"Fields\". \nIf you do not see a mapping for \"Stage <> Status\", click the \"+Add\" button to map \"Stage <> Status\". \nHover over the field and click on the dropdown arrow that appears on the right side of the page. Select \"Advanced\". Check the box that says \"Mapped Field\" and under the external mapped type select \"Lead Status\" from the dropdown menu. Check the box that says \"Map name instead of ID\" and click the \"Done\" button.\nSave your changes.\n\nMapping Contact Statuses\nUnlike lead status, the only action needed on the contact object is mapping the correct fields. It is best practice to have your Salesforce Lead and Contact Status have the same values. Since Contact Status in SFDC is a custom field, it does not come out of the box and does not come with a standard ID; therefore the plugin field mappings are a little bit different. \n\nIf you are the Outreach admin, click on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach Platform. On the settings panel, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Plugins\".\nClick into the Salesforce plugin and on click into the \"Contact\" object.\nOn the top of the page, click \"Fields\". On the top right hand side of the page click \"Add\" and, instead of the field in Outreach Called \"Stage\", map 'Stage Name' to the Contact Status field in Salesforce.\n\n\nAs updates are made to the lead and contact status, the changes will be reflected both in the Outreach platform and on the lead/contact profiles in Salesforce.\nIf you have different values for Lead and Contact Status in SFDC, please contact support at support@outreach.io for best practices and more information.

Click and open tracking are enabled if, when you click on the gear symbol, the engagement tracking options are checked. \n \nSequences, Templates & Snippets in Outreach Everywhere\nSimilar to features found in the web app, you can pull Outreach templates into the compose window. If the individual being emailed is a prospect in Outreach, and variables exist in the template, the Outreach Everywhere extension will automatically merge the variables with the corresponding prospect information.\nIf there are any missing variables in the template, Outreach will pop up a warning message letting you know there are unmerged variables that need to be modified.\nSnippets are available to add additional information or quickly answer a common question.\nProspects can also be added to follow-up sequences once the email is sent, and tasks can be scheduled for future follow - up. If a follow-up task or sequence is selected, the corresponding field in the compose window will be highlighted in Outreach blue. You can confirm the date/time for the follow-up task and/or see which sequence the prospect will be added to by hovering over the fields.\nReminders\nIf desired, you can create a follow-up task or bump the email to the top of your inbox after a specified period of time. You can request a follow-up task be generated or email bump sent to your inbox regardless of whether or not the prospect replies to your email.\nMeetings\nSend prospects available meetings times directly from the compose window, using previously created Meeting Types. Any booked meetings will automatically be recorded in Outreach.\nDelayed Delivery - \u201cSend Later\u201d\nAt the bottom of the compose window user can click on \u201csend now\u201d to immediately deliver the drafted email. \nAnother option is to schedule email delivery at a specified date and time, scheduled by clicking on the clock button found next to the \u201csend now\u201d button. If scheduled for a later date or time, a green confirmation bar appears at the bottom of the compose window and the delivery button texts updates to confirm that the email is set to \u201csend later\u201d. Make sure you click \"send later\" to schedule the email for delivery.\nSaving Drafts\nIf the email is scheduled for a delayed delivery, or if the compose window is accidentally closed, Outreach will save a draft of the email in the Gmail draft folder as well as in the Outreach outbox. \nOutreach Voice\nYou can create a new prospect or pull up the existing prospect's profile from the side panel to call from within Gmail." .

        _:360030906373 <article> " \nAdding an additional recipient into your Sequence \nStarting from an individual prospect, select the paper airplane to initiate the add to Sequence process. Optional: select a Collection if your sequences are organized in Collections. Select the name of Sequence you would like your prospect to be added to. Optional: Preview the steps in the sequence by selecting \u201cShow Steps\u201d so you know how the sequence is structured. \n\nOnce you select the sequence you\u2019d like you will be brought to a screen where you can add additional recipients. Simply select \u201c+ Add\u201d then start typing the name or email address of a Prospect or User to add someone as To or Cc. If a prospect or user with that email does not already exist we can still include that email as a recipient on the mailing. If an email address is added as a recipient that is on your org domain exclusion list, the entire mailing will fail. To remove a recipient from this list, simply select \u2018Edit\u2019 when hovering over the prospect\u2019s details.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see additional details on the Prospect/Recipient, just hover over their name to display a card with additional information about their Prospect details, activity, Sequences they are in and the status of those sequence.\n \n\nEditing Future Email Steps\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the Sequence and the Prospects/Recipients you\u2019d like added to the sequence, you can customize the email steps in the sequence by selecting \u201cEdit Steps\u201d. This will allow you to modify the email templates for every Prospect in the list of Prospects you\u2019ve selected. For example, if you have 5 Prospects in the Prospect list within the Add the Sequence window, your step customization will apply to all 5 Prospects. While customizing, you do not need to fill in the variables, those will populate automatically after you initiate the Sequence. If you\u2019d like to preview these emails, you can click \u201cShow preview\u201d to get an idea for what your message will look like once the variables populate and the email sends. You can even select \u201csend me a test email\u201d for Outreach to send you an email with the final version of your message.\n\nScheduling a Sequence to Start Later (Scheduled Start)\n When adding a prospect into Sequence, you can click the clock icon to select a different time for the sequence to start. This will add the prospect to the sequence and schedule the first step to start at this time.\n \nIf you schedule a sequence to start at a later date/time and that time is not within a delivery schedule window we will wait until the next delivery window to send the mailing or create the task. \nConfirmation Receipts\nOnce you\u2019ve added a prospect into sequence, Outreach will help you with your next action. For example, if you added prospects to a sequence with a manual first step we will prompt you to start those tasks immediately. If you made any errors and the prospect runs into a failure, we will direct you to fix those failures.\n\n\n \nFAQ\nHow does having multiple recipients in a Sequence interact with Org Settings, specifically, domain restrictions?\nWe will respect all org settings. For example, we will fail the mailing if a prospect is CC\u2019d who is on the domain exclusion list. Org domain throttles limits will apply to all recipients on the mailing. So, if you include 5 recipients from the domain on an email, we will count that 5 times against your domain throttle limit.\n \nHow do I make sure my reps don\u2019t accidentally use Grouped when they meant to use Individual?\nWhen selecting \u2018Grouped\u2019, a warning message will appear with a description of what this means, this should alleviate any confusion.\n \nHow will this impact the prospect activity feed?\nFor now, activities will only be displayed for the Primary Prospects. Soon, we will show activities in both the Primary and Secondary\u2019s activity feeds.\n \nIf I'm syncing Activity data up to Salesforce, which Lead or Contact record will it be assigned to?\nWhen syncing data to Salesforce, it will only associate with the Primary Prospect in the \"To\" field of the mailings. If there are multiple Prospects in the \"To\" field, this will sync up for the first Lead or Contact listed.\n \nHow do I govern my team from editing steps on certain Sequences?\nOn the sequence Ruleset you will find a checkbox that will limit users\u2019 ability to customize email steps on sequences from the Add to Sequence experience. This will also limit their ability to manually select/override A/B test selection. For Manual email steps, users will still be able to customize the message once the task becomes due.\n \nWhich prospects do triggers apply to?\nBoth Primary and Secondary. If a prospect is added to a sequence as a Secondary, we still count that as active in Sequence, so we will be able to detect it with triggers. Currently, you cannot add someone to a sequence via a trigger as a Secondary, Triggers can only add a single Prospect into a Sequence.\n \nWhat happens if a secondary recipient replies?\nWithin the Ruleset settings, you can configure what happens when a secondary replies. You have 2 options, \u201cFinish Sequence\u201d or \u201cPause Sequence\u201d. We recommend setting secondary replies to \u201cPause Sequence\u201d and an interval of \u201c2 Day\u201d. The reason for this is because if a user gets a reply from a secondary that they\u2019d prefer not to stop the sequence, they will have 2 days to resume the sequence otherwise it will auto-finish. Gmail users will be able to resume the sequence directly from their inbox upon opening the replied message.\n\n \n" .

        _:115004605147 <article> "This article is designed to help prevent you  avoid bounced emails and give a broad overview of the bounce messages you may receive. \nUnderstanding Bounce Messages\nThere are two types of bounces and a few reasons why they would occur:\n*1) Prospects have encountered a hard bounce (seen as a 5.x.x error). Below are some common reasons this could happen:\n\nRecipient email address does not exist i.e. you have an incorrect email address\nDomain name does not exist\nRecipient email server has completely blocked delivery. Please see the attached spam best practices guide\n\n*2) The email has encountered a soft bounce (seen as a 4.x.x error). Below are common reasons you would see a soft bounce occur:\n\nRecipient Mailbox is full (over quota)\nEmail message is too small\nEmail message is too large\nYour emails are image-only\nYour emails use red-flagged words like \"order status\", \"Desperate\", \"Double your income\", \"Invoice\", \"Sign-up free today\", and \"Online Pharmacy\", etc.\nYou didn't authenticate your sending domain\n\nYou can authenticate your sending domain in the following ways:\n\nSPF - Adds the IP addresses allowed to send email via your domain name in your DNS record\nDKIM - Also based on the DNS record, this authentication solution is used to sign emails with a public or private key system\nDMARC- This new technology allows the sender to check whether emails have been properly authenticated by the ISP or webmail\n\n\n\n*NOTE: Endpoint protection services (e.g. Symantec & McAfee) may block Outreach emails from being delivered to prospects. In this case, we would recommend enabling our Branded URLs feature within your Outreach account.\nWhat can I do to prevent bounces?  \nThe advice we typically give is to use a service to verify the emails you're are trying to send to. Email Hunter and Rapportive are free and work fairly well. DiscoverOrg and Datanyze are not free, but they are very effective. Kickbox.io is another good resource for verifying large lists.\nWe also advise that you target a much smaller audience at companies instead of targeting everybody with an email address. For instance, our sales team is only allowed to contact 5 people at a company at any given time. Basically, if you are sending the same 100 emails to the same companies servers in a day, there is a high chance that server will block you. Bulk email by definition is spam, so If you are sending a similar copy to a lot of recipients at the same company, their mailing servers are more likely to pick up on it.\nOutreach has a few ways that we can help. We have domain level throttling, which allows you to set the max number of emails one domain can be sent per 24 hours. We also have sequence throttling, which a lot of people overlook, but this is something that can not only help your workflow but also improve deliverability over the long run. Another thing here might be to limit the number of exact date and time sequences your users are running. The intervals of an interval sequence would help email deliverability as your emails would be spread out over a defined schedule of time, and not all delivered at the same time to your prospects. Lastly, as a final safety measure, if a large number of e-mails all bounce during a short time period, Outreach will temporarily lock your mailbox for 24 hours. This is to help ensure that your e-mail domain's reputation score is protected, as bounced e-mails can damage the reputation for your entire organization and mean that all of your e-mails are more likely to be flagged as Spam.\nAs far as domain monitoring, we recommend MXtoolbox. They can provide comprehensive blacklist checks and domain health reports.\nAttached is a guide on spam best practices; we recommend that you take a quick look so that all of the hard work you put into writing emails lands in the inboxes of your prospects.

        _:360020110033 <article> "Outreach can support opting prospects out from specific communication channels (email, call, texting), which leaves the door open for reps to reach out with other methods. For example, if a prospect opts out of emails Outreach will now be able to \u201cgranularly opt out\u201d the prospect from receiving any further email, but will still allow your rep to continue communicating with the prospect via phone or texting.\nWith this feature enabled, unsubscribe links will now only opt a prospect out of Email communication. If a rep connects with a prospect on a call, and the prospects requests to no longer be called, a rep can mark the prospect opted out specifically of future calls. In addition, any existing Opted Out prospects are updated to be opted out of all communication types.\nEnable Granular Opt Out by Communication Preferences\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nFind the section labeled \"User Admin\" on the setting panel that appears and select \"Org\".\nUnder the general org settings, find the section labeled \"Opt Out Options\" and enable  \u201cOpt Out by Communication Type\u201d checkbox. \n\n\n \nUsing Opt Out by Communication Preferences\nRulesets\nWith this feature enabled, an \u201cOpt Outs\u201d section is added to your Rulesets. These new settings will determine how you would like Outreach to handle opted out prospects in sequences. You can select to \u201cContinue and skip future ... steps\u201d if you would like Outreach to skip the steps a prospect is opted out of, or select if a prospect is opted out of any type of communication have Outreach finish that prospect from the sequence altogether. \n\n \nOpting a prospect out in Outreach\nSimilar to how reps opt out prospects today, to opt a prospect out navigate to a prospect\u2019s profile and under the edit drop down select the \u201cOpt Out\u201d option. This will prompt the new Opt Out option to appear, allowing reps to now select which communication type the prospect is opted out of. \n\n \nUpdating your SFDC plugin\nUpon enabling Opt Out by Communication Preferences, you will want to update the SFDC plugin. Updating the plugin requires a few steps, including:\n\nCreating the Email, Call, and SMS opt out fields in SFDC (if they do not already exist)\nUpdating the Outreach plugin for Leads\nUpdating the Outreach plugin for Contacts. \n\nCreating the fields in SFDC\nWhen creating the Email, Call, and SMS opt out fields in SFDC for Outreach to sync with, they will need to be a checkbox (true/false) field on the Lead and Contact page layout. \n\nNavigate to your Settings page\nUnder \u201cSystem Config\u201d go to the \u201cPlugins\u201d option and select \u201cSalesforce\u201d \nClick into the Lead/Contact object and go to the Lead/Contact \u201cFields\u201d tab\nUpdate the Lead/Contact Field Mappings by removing the existing Opt Out field, and adding the \u201cEmails Opted Out\u201d, \u201cCall Opt Out\u201d, and \u201cSMS Opt Out\u201d mappings. \n\n" .

        _:219370228 <article> "In sales, when you reach out to connect with someone, the standard practice in Outreach is to place them in a sequence. This gives you the best chance of receiving an initial response.\nOnce the prospect responds to one of your sequence emails, they will be automatically removed from the sequence. At this point, you will need to respond to the prospect's email from your inbox. This is where Follow-Up Sequences step in. Before you hit send on that email from your inbox (Gmail or Outlook), you can attach a Follow-Up Sequence to the email. This will ensure that if your prospect does not respond to your email, they will be automatically added to the Follow-Up Sequence.\nAs an Outreach best practice, we recommend you attach a Follow-Up Sequence to every email you send from your inbox that requires a response.\nBuilding Follow-Up Sequences\nCheck out our Sequence Blueprints for some pre-built, best-in-class Follow-Up sequences.\nAuto vs. Manual Email\nThere are two types of emails that you can have in a sequence: auto and manual.\nAuto email:  Emails will automatically send at the predesignated time, either a specific time and day or an interval of time after the first touch point.  There is no action required for the emails to send.\nManual email:  An email that, at a predesignated time, either a specific time and day or interval of time after the first touch point, will be queued as a task in Outreach for delivery.  Manual emails will not be sent until you manually send the email.  The prospect will remain at this step in the sequence until you make any necessary edits and send the email.\nIn both instances, if there is a reply, the person is automatically kicked out of the sequence.\nUnderstanding which type of email step to use is significant in designing your sequence.  For example, maybe you want the email to automatically send no matter what, based on your workflow?  Then an auto email is right for you.\nSample Reply Emails\nThe language should be simple and generic, since you're just checking in. When creating your follow-up sequence, your emails should always be a \"Reply\" type, found on top of the email compose window when adding an email sequence step. This will automatically create a thread, attaching the email you deliver from your inbox to the sequence reply email (more below).\nThese 3 templates are examples of verbiage that we use to \"check in\" during the follow up sequence:\n\nUsing a Follow-Up Sequence (Gmail)\nFollow-up sequences should last about 10-15 days in order to give the contact time to respond. We typically end the sequence with a generic task deciding what to do next.\nTo add a prospect to a follow-up sequence, open the prospect message you're replying to in your inbox. After completing your email response, click on the Sequence button on the top of the compose window.\n\nSelect the Sequence you would like to use. Feel free to select \"Preview Steps\" if you'd like to familiarize yourself with the Steps in the Sequence. Then, select the Sequence you would like to use.\nNext, choose who you would like to be the primary prospect (if there are multiple recipients). The primary prospect is the individual that will be used by Outreach to fill out variables, associte with reporting, and determines which lead/contact activities will sync to your CRM on behalf of.\nCheck to make sure none of the prospects are in other sequences or are not opted out. If they are, depending on the setting of these sequences, there is a chance your follow-up sequence will fail. \nFinally, if you'd like to customize when the Follow-Up Sequence will start, you can simply select the clock icon, and find the right time for the sequence to begin. Keep in mind, the sequence will only begin if there is no response to the email you are about to send.\nSelect \"Set Follow-Up\" and then send your email by selecting \"Send Now\"\n\n \n " .

        _:221395027 <article> "As your Prospects enter Sequences in Outreach, this engagement information can be pushed up to your CRM to grant you and your team greater visibility to the revenue-driving activities within Outreach. These fields contain information about the current active sequence that is engaging the prospect, including the sequence state, sequence step type, when the next sequence step is due, and the who is assigned to the activity.\nYou'll need to add new Type fields to the Lead/Contact Layout with the appropriate Field Level Security. The process to update Field Level Security will vary, depending on your CRM.\nWe suggest Admins create a number of custom fields to hold the information on the Lead or Contact record, and recommend adding the following fields under a new layout section, which we\u2019ve labeled \u201cEngagement Panel\u201d. Below are suggested fields, as well as the appropriate field type:\n\n\n\nName of Field\nDescription\nField Type\n\n\nActively being Sequenced\nTrue/False value if the prospect is active in the sequence\nCheckbox\n\n\nName of Currently Active Sequence\nName of the sequence the Lead/Contact is currently in\nPlain Text\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Status\nContains the State the prospect is in, such as Pending, Paused, Paused OOTO, Failed or Active\nPlain Text\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Step Number\nNumber of the sequence Step the lead/contact is currently in\nNumeric\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Step Type\nIndicates the step type such as an Auto Email, Manual Email, or Call Task\nPlain Text\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Task Due Date\nDue date of the manual task\nDate Field\n\n\nCurrent Sequence User Name\nThe user name of the individual currently sequencing the prospect.\nPlain Text\n\n\nCurrent Sequence User Integration ID\nLookup value for the User ID\nPlain Text\n\n\nID of Currently Active Sequence\nThe sequence ID the prospect is associated with. This number is found in the URL of the specific sequence's overview page.\nPlain Text\n\n\nNumber of Active Sequences\nIndicates how many sequences the Lead/Contact is currently in\nNumeric\n\n\nNumber of Active Sequence Tasks\nIndicates how many active sequence tasks are assigned to the prospect \nNumeric\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Step Actor\nDisplay name of current task owner\nLookup Relationship (User)\n\n\nCurrent Sequence Step Actor Role\nDisplay role of current sequence task owner\nPlain Text\n\n\n\nNote: If a Prospect is in multiple Sequences concurrently, Outreach will only push the most recent Sequence Activity.\nMapping Outreach Fields to the Engagement Panel \nOnce the engagement panel is set up in your CRM, the Outreach Admin can update the plugin mappings with these fields. As prospects move through the sequence, the values will change and push to your CRM. \n\nTo add the field mappings in Outreach, go to the plugin, select the type (either contact, lead or both), and select the fields tab. \nOn the top right corner of the page, click on the \u201cadd\u201d button to create a new mapping.\nOn the left side of the mapping, select the Outreach prospect field. On the right, find the corresponding Lead or Contact field. Select the \u201cupdate out\u201d checkbox and save your changes.\nRefresh the page to view the new mappings.\n\n\n With these mappings, Outreach will push the sequence data into your CRM for each prospect, constantly updating the data as the prospect moves through the sequence.\n\nNote: These fields will not be updated until the prospect moves forward in a sequence. Once there's a change to the prospect profile in Outreach, the engagement panel information will sync to your CRM. If you'd like to force update these fields, you can Force or Manually Sync Records with your CRM. \n \nClear Engagement Fields when Prospect is No Longer Active in Sequence\nIf you would like the Engagement Panel in your CRM to remove data when a Prospect is no longer Active in a Sequence, we will need to adjust the Advanced Field Mappings on the Object Fields section of the plugin.\n\nIn the plugin, navigate to the object that has the Sequence status fields you would like to update. These will be on the lead and/or contact objects.\nHover over the field(s) and click on the drop-down arrow that appears on the right side of the page, and select \"Advanced\"\nOn the pop-up box, remove the check mark for \"skip empty values when sending data to your CRM\". This allows Outreach to push an empty value to the CRM, clearing the associated field and updating the lead or contact record to show they are not active in a sequence. For more information, please see Advanced Field Mappings.\nSave your changes\n" .

        _:360015954093 <article> " \n Outreach offers an open API which will allow you to pull vast amounts of data and run specific analytics in the BI platform of your choice. This guide walks you through the initial steps to get your data out of Outreach and into the hands of your analytics team. \nWho should access the Outreach API?\nThe first step in this process is to identify the correct resource within your company that can help you get access to Outreach data. Typically, this is the team that owns your data warehouse, and may run analytics for your business. They could be:\n\nBI or Analytics team, or any team that owns your data storage and transformation\nOr, in the case of smaller organizations, a single Software engineer may own analytics\n\n Secondly, you will need someone who can assist in the process of correlating the data to actions. Your Salesforce Admin or Sales Manager can play an important role here in helping your data team understand how to interpret Outreach data related to sales performance. \nConnect to the Outreach API\nOnce you identified your team, provide them with the Outreach API information to get started. Here a few things to keep in mind when pulling in the data:\n\nWhere will the data be stored? Typically, this is a database solution like mysql, Redshift, or Snowflake. Most likely your team already has a preferred database warehouse.\nHow will the data be accessed? This will require some light scripting using Python, Curl, Java, ... See a sample here.\nHow often will the data be refreshed? We recommend a 24h refresh rate or if you prefer more up to date data you could pull it multiple times per day. We internally pull our data 4 times per day.\n\n Leverage the Data for Analytics\nNow that you have all the data collected in your database you can connect it to your favorite analytics platform (Tableau, Domo, or PowerBI, for example) to start performing your own custom analytics. Be sure to assist your BI team in the process of correlating the data to actions.\nTo get you started here are a few data points you will have access to and can start to explore:\n\nActivities: emails, calls, tasks\nContent: sequences, templates, snippets\nMeetings: meeting types, booked meetings, hold rate\n\nTemplate to Get Your Data Team Involved\nIf you are not sure how to get your data team involved then you can use the template below to get the conversation started.\nHi {{first_name}},\nOur sales team uses Outreach.io as part of their core tool stack to build their pipeline and close deals faster. We are able to learn some insights through reports in Outreach and Salesforce. But with your help we would be able to gather much deeper insights and make our sales team even more effective. \nOutreach has an open API allows us to pull in data directly from Outreach and analyze in our BI tool helping us to better coach the team and optimize our process. You can find more info on the Outreach API here. \nLet\u2019s find some time next week to walk through this to see how we can get this completed and learn more about the data we are looking for.\nCheers,\n{{sender.first_name}}\n \nResources\n\nAPI documentation\nRequest API access\n\n " .

Note: Your Salesforce report must be saved in the \u201cUnfiled Public Reports\u201d folder to successfully import into Outreach.\nSelect the appropriate report and click \u201cNext\u201d on the top right hand side of the page.\nMap the columns of your Salesforce Report to corresponding fields in Outreach. For example: \"Opportunity Name\" field in Outreach is mapped to the \"Opportunity Name\" column in the Salesforce report. If there are fields that aren't needed in Outreach, you can leave the mapping blank and they will not be imported into Outreach.\nClick next and on the third import screen select an owner for all the records in the Salesforce report.

You can select a new owner from the dropdown menu or select \"use owner from data\", found at the top of the dropdown menu.\nDecide what to do with duplicates. Update Missing Fields will update only fields on the prospect that are not already present. Overwrite Existing Fields will replace existing information on the prospect with the information contained in the spreadsheet (overwritten fields only apply to fields  mapped in the second step of the import). Skip will skip updating information on prospects that already exist in Outreach.\nAdd tags to the list of records to easily find and group them together (optional)\nLoad additional data from Salesforce to sync the Opportunities with their corresponding Accounts, prospects, and Opportunity Roles with the corresponding lead/contact in Salesforce.\n\nClick \"Next\" and \"Start Import\" when you're ready.\n\n \n \n" .

        _:360007226754 <article> "Outreach Opportunities allows users to manage and track opportunities through the entire sales pipeline, enabling them to engage in more meaningful ways and measure revenue attribution down to the activity. \nWe suggest having an Outreach Admin follow our comprehensive setup guide to use Outreach Opportunities effectively. The setup guide will walk you through the following topics:\n\nCreating the opportunity stages in Outreach\nAdding custom fields for opportunities in Outreach\nCreating a picklist field for Contact Roles \nUpdating your CRM plugin\nUpdating governance profiles to permit or deny access and actions on Opportunities\nImport historic opportunities\n\nCreate Opportunity Stages in Outreach\n\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach platform.\n\n\nOn the settings panel, find the system labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cOpportunity\u201d.\n\n\nOn the top of the page, Select \"Stages\".\n\n\nRemove any stages that are not needed and add stages as they appear in your CRM. The name of the stage needs to be mapped 1:1, including spacing and capitalization to ensure proper sync between Outreach and your CRM. For example, if you have the stage 'Redlines' in Outreach, you need to have the same status ''Redlines\u201d in your CRM. \n\n\nMake sure you\u2019re using stage names that are useful to your business and workflow. For example, you may need Opportunity stages for your new business pipeline, but might not find them necessary for account renewals.\n\n\nAdd Opportunity Custom Fields\nWith custom fields, you can create exactly the fields you need to hold the information that's most important about your Opportunities. In essence, custom fields help accommodate non-standard fields in your CRM that you want to use in Outreach. \nNaming your custom fields is helpful to keep everything linear across the whole org and ensure people are importing the correct information into the correct custom fields. This also allows them to show up as a named field on the Opportunity level within the plugin field mappings for your CRM.\nOutreach defaults every user to 35 custom fields, but more can be added to your account if requested.\n\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of Outreach\n\n\nUnder \"System Config\" select \"Opportunity\"\n\nYou'll see a list of custom fields where you can create labels, which will help you identify what information is being pulled into Outreach from your CRM. \n\nOnce a custom field label has been entered and saved, that field will be available in the Opportunity settings. You can also apply picklist validations to your custom fields. See the next section for more info.\nNote: Outreach Custom fields are limited to 30k characters. \nCreate your Contact Role Validation Picklist\nPicklist support allows Outreach admins to define specific values for a prospect or account field. By creating a picklist in Outreach, Admins can mirror your CRM picklist validations in Outreach, ensuring data remains accurate and consistent for new values added to prospects and account fields.\nFor sales reps, picklists help you remember correct field names, and ensure they're logged correctly to match the one in SFDC (i.e. Entering \u201chealth-care\u201d vs \u201chealthcare\u201d) - increasing efficiency and accuracy.\nNote: Picklist support can be used even if you don\u2019t use a CRM! It\u2019s a great way to ensure that data entry from your team is pristine and consistent.\nTo set up picklist validation in Outreach, admins will need to create a picklist in Outreach that matches the field names in your CRM.\n\nClick on your initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform\nOn the settings panel, find the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cValidations\u201d\nOn the top right corner of the page, click the \u201cAdd\u201d button to create a new picklist.\nSelect \u201cProspect Roles\u201d from the \u201cType\u201d dropdown menu. Under \u201cField\u201d, select \u201cRole\u201d. (To apply picklist validation to a custom field, select \"Opportunity\" from the \"Type\" dropdown menu. Under \"Field\", select the desired custom field.)\nOn the next page, start adding the picklist values that exist in your CRM, if your company uses one. If these fields are syncing to a CRM, the Outreach picklist values must match the corresponding CRM values 1:1, including spacing and capitalization, to sync correctly. You can quickly add additional values by clicking \u201center\u201d after each entry. If you make a mistake, click on the trash can symbol to remove the incorrect picklist value.\nOnce you\u2019ve completed adding the picklist values, select \u201ccreate\u201d.\n\nOnce a picklist is created, the contact role will appear as a dropdown option when assigning a prospect to an Opportunity.\n\n\nSetup the Plugin for your CRM\nWith your CRMs plugin, you have the option to bring Opportunities into Outreach automatically from your CRM.\nWe recommend keeping outbound create and update off. Opportunities can have many validation rules that must be met to create new Opportunities or update existing Opportunities. Because there is no visibility into those validation rules from within Outreach, the creation and updating of Opportunities should remain in your CRM.\nIf you use Salesforce, a comprehensive step-by-step guide to the Salesforce plugin can be found here. If you have been working with your Customer Success Manager or the support team to enable Advanced Task Mappings on your account, please review the Salesforce setup steps found in this article.\nAssign Governance Profile Settings\nEach profile is configured to allow and deny certain permissions. By default, non-admins will not be able to create, edit or see the Opportunities dropdown option (more details below).\nSome individuals may need to have access to certain actions. For example, the SDR team may be in charge of creating an Opportunity once they have a confirmed SAL/MQL, but only the AE should be permitted to make edits to the Opportunity as the deal moves through the pipeline.\nTo permit or deny certain actions, Outreach Admins can update the different Governance Profile Settings.\nThere are a few reasons organizations would want to enable or disable profile settings for Outreach Opportunities:\n\nThe Outreach and CRM Admins want to limit manual updates to opportunities.\nThe Outreach and CRM Admins want to adjust the plugin and Opportunity Stages before allowing access to Opportunities for their Outreach users \nOne team needs access to the Opportunities in Outreach (eg. AE), while other teams do not (eg. SDRs)\n\nAdjusting the Outreach Opportunities Governance Profile Settings\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach platform and under \"User Admin\" select \"Profiles\".\nSelect the profile that needs adjustment. You'll be brought into an overview page of every setting that has associated changes.\n\nScroll down the page until you see the section labeled \"Opportunities\". From the dropdown menu, select \"Permitted\" or \"Denied\" for each of the following options:\n\n\nCan Use Opportunities\n\nPermitted - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are allowed to use Outreach Opportunities.\nDenied - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are cannot use Outreach Opportunities.\n\nCreate\n\nPermitted - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are allowed to create opportunities.\nDenied - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are cannot create opportunities.\n\nEdit\n\nAny opportunity- Users can make changes to opportunities owned by anyone in their instance.\nOpportunity owned by user or its subordinates - Users can make changes to opportunities they own and team leaders can also make changes to opportunities owned by members of their team.\nOpportunity owned by user -Users can only make changes to opportunities that they own.\nDisabled -Users are unable to edit any opportunities.\n\nActivities Get Associated with Opportunities\n\nPermitted - Activities completed by the user will be associated with the prospect\u2019s opportunities.\nDenied - Activities completed by the user will not be associated with the prospect\u2019s opportunities.\n\nAssociation dropdown\n\nPermitted - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are allowed to manually associate activities with opportunities, via a drop-down when completing an activity.\nDenied - Individuals that are assigned to this governance profile are unable to manually associate activities with opportunities. Instead, activities will be automatically associated with the prospect\u2019s most recently created or updated open opportunity depending on the setting selected in Opportunities settings.\n\nImport Historic Opportunities\nThere are two options for importing historic opportunities into Outreach: CSV File or Salesforce report. We\u2019ll walk through both options.\nImport an Opportunity Salesforce Report\nIf you use Salesforce, follow these steps to import an Opportunity Salesforce Report into Outreach:\n\nClick the \"Quick Action\" or the lighting icon in the upper right hand corner and choose \"Bulk Create\"\nOn the import page, click on the dropdown and select \u201cOpportunity Salesforce Report\u201d. Note: Your Salesforce report must be saved in the \u201cUnfiled Public Reports\u201d folder to successfully import into Outreach.\nSelect the appropriate report and click \u201cNext\u201d on the top right hand side of the page.\nMap the columns of your Salesforce Report to corresponding fields in Outreach. For example: \"Opportunity ID\" field in Outreach is mapped to the \"Opportunity Name\" column in the Salesforce report. If there are fields that aren't needed in Outreach, you can leave the mapping blank and they will not be imported into Outreach.\nClick next and on the third import screen select an owner for all the records in the Salesforce report. You will have have the following options:\n\nThe owner will default to the individual importing the Opportunity. You can select a new owner from the dropdown menu or select \"use owner from data\", found at the top of the dropdown menu.\nDecide what to do with duplicates. Update Missing Fields will update only fields on the prospect that are not already present. Overwrite Existing Fields will replace existing information on the prospect with the information contained in the spreadsheet (overwritten fields only apply to fields  mapped in the second step of the import). Skip will skip updating information on prospects that already exist in Outreach.\nAdd tags to the list of records to easily find and group them together (optional)\nLoad additional data from Salesforce to sync the Opportunities with their corresponding Accounts, prospects, and Opportunity Roles with the corresponding lead/contact in Salesforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Next\" and \"Start Import\" when you're ready. \n\n\nImport an Opportunity CSV File into Outreach\nCSV files are a reliable way to import a list of Opportunities into Outreach. A CSV is a \"comma separated values\" file, which allows data to be saved in a table structured format, similar to Excel files (.xls).\nNote: The Closed Date field must be in MM/DD/YYYY (Month/Day/Year) format.\n\nClick the \"Quick Action\" or the lighting icon in the upper right hand corner and choose \"Bulk Create\"\nOn the import page, click on the dropdown and select \u201cOpportunities comma-separated values file (.csv)\u201d. Select your file and click the Next button on the top right corner.\nMap the columns of your CSV to corresponding fields in Outreach. For example: \"Name\" field in Outreach is mapped to the \"Opportunity Name\" column in the CSV file. If your CSV file contains data that is not relevant for Outreach, you can leave them unmapped and they will not be imported into Outreach.\nClick next and on the third import screen select an owner for all the records in the CSV. You will have have the following options:\n\nThe owner will default to the individual importing the Opportunities. You can select a new owner from the dropdown menu or select \"use owner from data\", found at the top of the dropdown menu.\nDecide what to do with duplicates. Update Missing Fields will update only fields on the Opportunities that are not already present. Overwrite Existing Fields will replace existing information on the Opportunities with the information contained in the spreadsheet (overwritten fields only apply to fields mapped in the second step of the import). Skip will skip updating information on prospects that already exist in Outreach.\nAdd tags to the list of records to easily find and group Opportunities together (optional)\nLoad additional data from your CRM to sync the Opportunities with the corresponding data in that CRM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \"Next\" and \"Start Import\" when you're ready.\n\n" .

        _:360005440094 <article> "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring multiple stages of the buyer's journey, you need a way to fairly and evenly distribute meetings across teams. You want to ensure that unassigned prospects and customers have as many times as possible to choose from when they are booking a meeting with a rep, so no meeting falls through the cracks. Team Meetings lets you evenly distribute meetings and increase the rate of meetings being scheduled.\nYou have three choices of how you would like to assign meetings of a particular type: Manual, Round Robin - Strict, and Round Robin - Flexible. These options influence who a particular meeting is assigned to both when it is booked within the Outreach application (outbound) as well as when it is booked by a prospect via the public calendar or Insert Availability links (inbound).\nEnabling Team Meetings\n\nClick on the calendar icon, found on the navigation panel on the left hand side of the Outreach platform.\nOn the top of the page, click the \u201cTypes\u201d tab.\nCreate a new Meeting Type or find the Meeting Type that needs to be included as a team meeting.\nScroll to the bottom of the page until you see a section labeled \u201cTeam Meeting Settings\u201d. The \"Team Meetings\" section has three options: Manual, Round Robin - Strict, and Round Robin - Flexible.\n\nManual: Manual assignment of meetings is the classic behavior. Outreach users booking a meeting will select an assignee for the meeting from a complete list of all users with connected calendars. There is no provided ordering. Public calendar and insert availability links are specific to an individual user, and allow meetings to be booked only on that single users calendar.\nThe two Round Robin meeting types help to distribute meetings evenly amongst a team. When a meeting is to be booked, the system calculates the number of meetings that each user has, and assigns the meetings to the user who has the fewest (see how meetings are counted).\n\n\nRound Robin - Strict: The strict variety of round robin provides strict enforcement that meetings are distributed evenly amongst team members. This variety of Round Robin places a strong emphasis on fairness, at the cost of flexibility.\nWhen Outreach users apply a \u201cRound Robin - Strict\u201d meeting type, the team member who currently has the least meetings booked for them will be selected as the assignee. This selection cannot be changed by the user for any reason.Public calendar links for \u201cRound Robin - Strict\u201d meeting types are linked to the team, rather than a specific user. When a prospect visits the public calendar link for these types, the user with the fewest meetings will automatically be selected. The prospect will be presented with their available times.When using Insert Availability, the assignee will be selected when the meeting type is applied. This works in the same way that an outbound meeting works. By selecting the assignee while drafting the email, Outreach users are able to provide accurate availability for a particular user.\nRound Robin - Flexible: The flexible variety of round robin provides functionality similar to \u201cRound Robin - Strict\u201d, but with an emphasis on flexibility.\nWhen Outreach users apply a \u201cRound Robin - Flexible\u201d meeting type, the team member who currently has the least meetings booked for them will be selected as the assignee. This selection can be changed by the users as needed to accommodate the prospect\u2019s schedule. When changing the assignee, users are displayed in order by their current meeting counts, from fewest to most.\nPublic calendar links for \u201cRound Robin - Flexible\u201d meeting types are linked to the team, rather than a specific user. When a prospect visits the public calendar link for these types, the user will be presented with the availability of all users on the team. Upon selecting a timeslot, the meeting will be booked for the user with the fewest meetings who is available at that time.\nWhen using Insert Availability, the assignee will be selected when the meeting type is applied. This works in the same way that an outbound meeting works. By selecting the assignee while drafting the email, Outreach users are able to provide accurate availability for a particular Outreach user.\nMeetings are assigned evenly amongst a team and cannot be adjusted by the meeting booker.\n\n\n\nSelect either strict or flexible round robin. Regardless of your choice, a new option will appear further down the screen. You can select an existing team, or add specific individuals to create a new team.Note: When selecting Teams, the maximum number of Users who can be assigned to a Round Robin Meeting is 50. If you attempt to use a Round Robin Team Meeting for a Team with more than 50 Users, you will only be able to view the first 50 on the Team. \n\nCreate a New Team - Click on the \u201ccreate a new team\u201d button. A pop-up box will appear where you can name your new team. Start typing the name of the Outreach users that should be included in the new team. As you type, available users will appear in a dropdown list. Continue adding new team members until you have everyone you need. Click the \u201c+Add\u201d button to save. The new team will automatically be applied to the Team Meeting settings. This team will be saved and stored under the team settings.\nSelect an Existing Team - Click on the dropdown menu to find the name of the team that needs to be associated with the meeting type. \n\n\nAfter adding a team to the meeting type, click on the \u201csettings\u201d button that appears to view more detail. A new window will appear with a list of the individuals contained in the selected team. Here, you can view a list of the Outreach users that are included in the team and check the individuals on the team you'd like to include in the queue. The assignee will receive meeting invitations for meetings booked using this meeting type. The options you select will will only apply to the meeting type you\u2019re adjusting. The settings will not apply to all meeting types that have been designated as a team meeting.\nOnce you've made your changes to the team, you can choose how you want to distribute meetings.\n\nIf the meeting is booked to hold this month - Outreach will distribute meetings evenly based on the number of meetings scheduled to be held in the current month. Out-of-month meetings will be credited to future months.\nAs soon as they're booked - Meetings are credited to a team member when the meeting is booked in their name, and then moves to the next person in the queue. \nYou also have the option to decide whether or not to include canceled and no-show meetings in the meeting count. \n\n\n\n \n \nBooking a Meeting with Team Meetings\n\nBook a meeting with a prospect in Outreach.\nApply a meeting type. You\u2019ll know the meeting type is a team meeting if there is a blue symbol next to the name of the meeting type.\nIf the meeting type is designated as a \u201cteam meeting,\u201d the meeting will automatically be assigned to the next person listed on the team, with all variables automatically filled out appropriately. If needed, you can add additional guests to the meeting invite.\nThe calendar field will automatically update with the assignee\u2019s availability, so you can select a time that works best for them.\n\n If you're using flexible queue logic, you have the option to reassign the meeting to any of the individuals on the team. Next to the section labeled \u201cAssign to calendar\u201d click on \u201cChange Assignee.\" A list of individuals on the team will appear. You can click through multiple assignees to see who\u2019s available. Select the individual you want to assign the meeting to and their name will highlight blue. They will also have a badge that indicates that they are being assigned to the meeting. Once you\u2019ve selected an assignee, click \u201cConfirm\u201d and the meeting type will update with the new assignee\u2019s information. \n\n\nWhen the calendar invite is sent, the meeting will automatically be added to the prospect and Outreach user\u2019s calendar, along with an email notification.\n\nInserting Availability with Team Meetings\n\nInsert availability from your inbox, either in Gmail or Outlook.\nApply a meeting type. You\u2019ll know the meeting type is a team meeting if there is a blue symbol next to the name of the meeting type.  \nIf the meeting type is designated as a \u201cteam meeting,\u201d the meeting will automatically be assigned to the next person listed on the team, with all variables automatically filled out appropriately.

        _:360021383493 <article> "Outreach\u2019s inbound delete feature lets Outreach mirror deletions and merge changes that occur in Salesforce. For example, if a Lead is recycled in Salesforce, the corresponding Outreach prospect would be recycled. \nNote: Inbound Merge and Delete is only currently available on the Contact, Lead, and Account objects. We recommend setting up this feature in the same order this documentation is outlined.\nIf you don't find what you're looking for here, check out our Merge & Delete FAQ page!\nEnabling Merge and Delete\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cPlugins.\u201d Click into the Salesforce plugin.\nClick \"Settings\" at the top of the page.\nEnable the toggle labeled \"Sync merged and deleted records.\"\nBy default, Leads, Contacts, and Accounts will all be enabled with this feature. You can uncheck any of these object types here if you would prefer Merge & Delete not be enabled for them. \nHit \"Save\" in the top right. A window will appear prompting you to schedule a cleanup -- we'll talk about this option more below!\n\nSalesforce Plugin Adjustments\nNow that you have Merge & Delete enabled, you should first consider how prospects that are active in a sequence should be treated once deleted in Salesforce. By default when enabling Merge & Delete, prospects marked for deletion will not be removed from the sequence. \nHowever some businesses want all prospects, regardless of sequence state (active, pending, paused), to be deleted in Outreach when deleted in Salesforce. If you agree, you\u2019ll need to follow these steps (if you've just completed the steps above, skip to step 4):\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cPlugins.\u201d Click into the Salesforce plugin.\n\n\n\nClick \"Settings\" at the top of the page.\nUnder the \"Sync merged and deleted\" records toggle, uncheck the box labeled \"Do not delete prospects if in an active, paused, or pending sequence.\"\n\nNote: This setting applies to all record types for which Merge & Delete is enabled. \nSchedule a Clean Up of Historical Records\nOnce you\u2019ve decided how to treat prospects that are active in sequence, you can schedule a date for Outreach to clean up data. When the date for the record clean up arrives, Outreach looks at all of the records in Outreach with external Salesforce IDs and tries to find a corresponding record in Salesforce using the Object ID. If the record does not exist in Salesforce anymore, Outreach will move the record to the Outreach recycling bin (we\u2019ll talk more about the recycling bin later).  Outreach will not delete records that were never in Salesforce. Only records that have an associated Salesforce mapping will be touched by the clean up process.\nNote: The data clean up will begin at 12:00am Pacific Time on the date scheduled. We recommend scheduling the data clean up during the weekend, especially if your organization has a large volume of prospects and accounts. The process can take a few hours to perform and we don\u2019t want your team to be interrupted during their daily workflow. \nNote: Scheduled record clean ups are applied to all objects for which Merge & Delete is enabled.\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cPlugins.\u201d Click into the Salesforce plugin. \nClick \"Settings\" at the top of the page.\nUnder the section labeled \"Clean up historical records,\" choose the date you\u2019d like the data clean up to run. Hit Save in the top right. \n\n\nReview Deleted Objects in the Recycling Bin\nThe recycling bin is where Outreach prospects and Accounts appear if a corresponding record was deleted or merged in Salesforce. The recycling bin is a sort & filter option found on the listview page of the corresponding record type (Prospects and/or Accounts). \n\nFor this example, find the silhouette icon on the Outreach navigation panel.\nClick on the \u201cViews & Filters\u201d button on the top of the page, if it isn\u2019t already visible.\nIn the \u201cViews & Filters\u201d panel, select \u201cSort & Filter.\u201d Find the section labeled \u201cSearch Options\u201d and select \u201cRecycled.\u201d \n\nIf you want to see all prospects marked for deletion, make sure you clear the \u201cowned by me\u201d filter on the top of the page. The filter will show all Leads and Contacts that have been deleted in Salesforce and are now marked for deletion in Outreach.\n\n\nMake sure you review this list carefully! This is your opportunity to ensure records have been marked appropriately.\n\n\nRepeat steps 1-5 for Accounts as needed.\n\n\nMake Adjustments to Recycled Records\nRecords found in the recycling bin in Outreach are living in a limbo state for 15 days before they are formally deleted from the system. This means you have time to make adjustments to the records if you think a deletion was done in error or if you\u2019d like to bypass the 15 day timeline.\nRemove Records from the Recycling Bin\nRecords that have been incorrectly deleted can be \u201cundeleted.\u201d \n\nClick on the checkbox next to the records that need to be removed from the recycling bin.\nOn the top of the page, find the \u201cViews & Filters\u201d button. Just to the right you\u2019ll see a new button with an ellipsis. Click on this button and select \u201cundelete.\u201d The records will be removed from the recycling bin and you will no longer see them in your recycled list.\n\n\nPermanently Delete Records in the Recycling Bin\nIf you\u2019re ready to permanently delete records from the recycling bin, follow the same steps! Select the records that you\u2019re ready to permanently delete from Outreach, click on the ellipses button on the top of the page, and select \u201cPermanent Delete.\u201d The prospects will be fully removed from Outreach.\n \n \n \n\n \nEnable Automatic Deletion of Recycled Records\nBy default, the Outreach records will stay in the recycling bin in perpetuity unless an Outreach admin manually deletes them from Outreach.\nIf you\u2019d like Outreach to automatically delete prospects and accounts that have been deleted or merged in Salesforce, you can enable the \u201cSoft-Delete Settings.\u201d With this setting, the Outreach records prospects and Accounts that are in the recycling bin will stay in your recycling bin for 15 days. Once 15 days have passed, Outreach will automatically and permanently delete the records. \n \n\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform.\n\n\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cUser Admin\u201d and select \u201cOrg.\u201d\n \n\nScroll down the org settings page until you see the setting labeled \u201cSoft-Delete Settings.\u201d\n\n\nClick on the checkbox and save your changes.\n \n\nAdjust Governance Profiles \nGovernance profiles allow you to designate who in your Outreach account should be able to see recycled and undelete recycled prospects and accounts. By default, all non-admin profiles will be denied permission to view and undeleted recycled records. \n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nFind the section labeled \"User Admin\" on the settings panel that appears and select \"Profiles.\"\nFind the profile that you want to adjust.\nScroll down the profile permissions page until you see a section labeled \"Soft Delete.\"\nMake adjustments to the view/undelete permissions as desired.\n\nDidn't find what you were looking for?

        _:360030744533 <article> "Outreach checks all account throttles when scheduling email deliveries to determine which emails can be delivered immediately. \nThrottles are rules that control when and how many emails can be delivered. A few examples include:\n\nThe Sequence Schedule determines when an email can be delivered to a prospect. This gives you the ability to control when to communicate to prospects without needing to worry about delivering an email at off hours, especially if you\u2019re reaching out to prospects across multiple time zones. \nThe Daily Max Domain throttle controls how many emails can be sent to a specific domain (for example, @Outreach.io) within a 24 hour period. This type of throttle helps encourage engagement with your emails (opens, clicks, and replies).\nThe Daily Sending Limit throttle controls how many emails can be sent from Outreach every 24 hours. If it is a Friday afternoon and you met your daily sending limit, Outreach ensures the mailing waits and sends on Monday, instead of Saturday afternoon (based on your sequence schedule). \n\nFind Delayed Emails \nIf you notice that your emails are not delivering at the time you anticipated:\n\nClick on the outbox icon on the left hand navigation panel in Outreach\nOn the top of the outbox page, click on the \u201cScheduled\u201d emails\nDelayed emails will have a yellow box with a warning symbol.

        _:115006126308 <article> "Purpose:\nThe purpose of this article is to provide Outreach users with recommended best practices when using Outreach Voice. \nAll web-based software can experience performance issues relating to the connections and its operational environment. Existing systems or connection issues may not be as noticeable during normal usage of Outreach functionalities, but can become more outstanding when using Outreach Voice, which contains more strict bandwidth requirements.\nDue to the nature of computer-based calls, call quality can highly depend on the network speed, number of concurrent calls, the specific client device, etc. To help Outreach users optimize the quality of Outreach Voice, Outreach has compiled a list of best practices for both end-users and IT administrators (network engineers) when setting up Outreach Voice.\nBest Practices for Outreach Voice Users\nOS, Browser & Hardware\nThe device hardware requirements are dependent on a combination of factors, but generally Outreach recommends the following: \n\nUse the most recent version of Google Chrome.\nHave 8GB of memory.\nClose CPU/Network-intense web pages such as video/audio streaming services. \nConnect with an Ethernet cable if applicable to reduce latency experienced with WiFi. \n\nIn the unlikely scenario that Outreach calls drop, intermittent issues in Outreach Voice can be resolved by clearing the browser cache and history. For more information on clearing browsing data, refer to the How To Clear History and Browsing Data in Google Chrome article. \nHeadsets\nHeadsets can improve audio quality by minimizing echo and background noise. Outreach recommends using a headset on computer-based calls to provide acoustic isolation between the speaker and microphone, and to minimize echo.\nHeadset for lower-end PC hardware: For lower-end PC hardware, Outreach recommends USB Headsets, rather than 3.5mm jack headsets, which bypass the native sound board. \nWhen selecting bluetooth hardware: Bluetooth headsets can present unique challenges, as each headset operates differently. If your headset came with a USB bluetooth adapter, Outreach recommends you use the USB adapter, rather than bluetooth to avoid issues.\nNote: Static on the call can often be caused by an improperly configured headset. If you are experiencing static, try another headset or no headset to narrow down potential sources.\nFor more information regarding properly configuring audio settings for Outreach Voice, refer to the How To Configure Call Audio Settings article. \n " .

Various laws and policies have been enacted both inside and outside of the US regarding the use of unsubscribe links in 'cold', outbound emails.\nIn the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 outlines the rules and regulations around cold emailing and the use of unsubscribe links, but it's application is not as regulated as other countries, such as Canada, which has a more rigid policy. \nIt is important to look over these regulations before mailing prospects both in and outside of the US. \nDo I have to use an unsubscribe link?\nWe strongly recommend including the opt out link in all outgoing messages coming from a sequence. We recommend this for two reasons:\n\nCAN-SPAM Act of 2003\nUsing an opt out link is helpful to keep data integrity\n\nProspects who do not have the option to 'opt out' but want to remove themselves from your emails will have to reply directly to you and request you to opt them out. \nIn doing so, these prospects will be counted as a Reply, which may negatively affect your reply rates.\n\n\nWhile we do recommend this practice, it is not required when using Outreach. Users can turn off the unsubscribe link by un-ticking the check box located in the Settings tab of any given sequence. \n " .

        _:360012861873 <article> "To help you better understand why a message bounced, we categorize bounces into different bounce categories. Below is a breakdown of the category, the short description included within the Outreach platform, and a longer description which provides a bit more detail. \nBounce Categories\nFlagged as Spam\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cThis message was flagged by spam by the recipient\u2019s mailbox\u201d\nEvery email that lands in your prospects inbox can be marked as spam. This message indicates that either your email was flagged by your customer\u2019s IT team as spam because it did not meet their criteria to pass through to the designated mailbox, or your customer clicked on the \u201cmark as spam\u201d button when they saw your email in their inbox. \nThese emails should not be retried, since they will continue to bounce and potentially affect your email deliverability. \nInvalid Email\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cThe recipient email address does not exists\u201d\nThe bounce message tells us that the email address was either entered incorrectly or is no longer an active mailbox (i.e. the prospect has left the company). This error is specific to the local part and/or email domain. The local part is the text found on the left of the @ symbol (rsiegel@), and the domain is the text found on the right of the at symbol(@outreach.io). If you believe this bounce message was received in error, make sure that the domain is spelled correctly and has the right domain end (.io, .com, .org, .edu, etc.). If the domain is correct, make sure the local part is correct (rachael.siegel@ vs resiegel@ vs rsiegel@). If the bounce error persists, then it is likely that the prospect has left the company and their emails are not being forwarded to another individual, such as a colleague or their manager. \nIt is possible, though unlikely, that the prospect\u2019s email account has been suspended and is temporarily unable to accept emails.\nMailbox Full\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cThe recipient\u2019s mailbox is full and cannot accept accept messages\u201d\nSome organizations set a limit on the number of emails an individual can have in their inbox at one time. Once the individual clears out old messages from their inbox, either by moving them into different folders or deleting them entirely, they\u2019ll be able to receive new email.  This is a temporary error, so emails that receive this bounce category can be safely retried.\nIf you continue to receive this error after attempting to redeliver, it\u2019s likely the email address is no longer in use.\nRejected by Recipients Mailbox\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cThis message was rejected by the recipient's mailbox due to a policy violation or security error\u201d\nBounce messages that are rejected with this error are rejected due to the administrative settings the prospect\u2019s company\u2019s IT team has enabled as protection against unvetted senders. \nRejected due to Message Size\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cThis message exceeded the maximum size the recipient's mailbox accepts.\u201d\nThis bounce message is letting you know that your email was not delivered to your prospect because it is too big. Size limits are set by the prospect\u2019s company\u2019s IT team, who do not provide visibility into what, specifically, is causing the email size to exceed the limit. This is often a combination of email elements, including the amount of text, attachments, and embedded images. \nAlternatively, it\u2019s possible that a single element, such as an attachment, is too large. Outreach recommends a combined email size of no more than 5MB, including images and attachments. We\u2019d also suggest compressing images into smaller files. A balance of text with images and attachments are best practice for email deliverability.\nUnable to Connect to Recipient Mailbox\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cMessage delivery was delayed by recipient's mailbox. Try again.\u201d In some cases, bounces are caused due to an error from the prospect\u2019s server. Unlike other bounce reasons, these are usually temporary errors and the bounced email can be retried for successful delivery.\nUnable to Determine Bounce Reason\nOutreach Short Description: \u201cNot enough information to determine bounce reason.\u201d\nBounce reasons are provided by your prospect\u2019s company\u2019s mailbox policies, which are set by IT Administrators. In most instances, some information is provided within the bounce message, which is where the bounce reason is provided. Bounce reasons are optional, so not every company will provide detail into why your message could not be delivered. If you received this bounce category, we either do not have enough detailed information about the email bounce to determine the cause, or the bounce reason is not in english." .

        _:216288348 <article> "\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSpam is considered irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent to a large number of recipients. Every country has a different definition of what spam in their country means. The most basic definition of spam is unsolicited email that is sent in bulk to a list of people in a short period of time.\nEmail itself is not inherently bad, and not all emails sent in bulk are marked as spam. However, if you're in sales it's important to understand laws that were passed to give individuals the right to opt out of email communication. For example, the United States has the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which requires that each individual does the following:\n\nNever use deceptive headers, From names, reply-to addresses, or subject lines\nAlways provide an unsubscribe link that works for at least 30 days after sending.\nInclude your physical mailing address, usually in your signature\n\nWhen using Outreach, it is up to the individual to follow these requirements. Remember, being marked as spam can have a detrimental impact on your organization's deliverability rates.\nWhat is a spam filter and how are they created?\nAs email becomes a standard method of communicating and selling, companies are working hard to ensure their teams are not bothered by emails they consider irrelevant or unwanted. They do this be creating filters that review an email before they're delivered to an inbox. \nSpam filters are configured by IT administrators, and each considers a long list of variable criteria when judging an email. They\u2019ll weigh each variable and assign a spam score, which determines whether an email will pass through the filter and land in the inbox. If the score exceeds a certain threshold, your email will get flagged as spam and go straight to the junk folder. \nThe criteria and variables that are considered upon receipt of an email are unique to each individual company. Some companies, such as governmental agencies and any companies that must comply with HIPAA, will have tighter restrictions than others. \nBecause every spam filter functions differently, there is no magic number to avoid landing in the junk folder. Below we outline the factors that contribute to your spam score, and offer a few best practices to avoid spam filters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors contribute to spam score?\n\nRelationship with subscriber - how acquainted are you with the person you're emailing?\nReputation of IP address and sender domain - If your emails have been continually marked as spam, your IP address and sender domain are negatively impacted, which decreases the likelihood that your emails land in the inbox.\nQuality of email subject line, teaser, and content - Using personalization is key. Outreach provides you with variables to quickly personalize your content from top to bottom. Short, but descriptive subject lines with balanced content (the ratio of images to text and links to text)\nQuality and safety of links in email\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices to Avoid Spam Filters\nComposing Emails\n\nDON\u2019T USE ALL CAPS IN YOUR SUBJECT LINE\nDon't use exclamation points!!!!!!!\nDon't use video, Flash, or JavaScript within your email\nAvoid large attachments and certain attachment types such as .exe, .zip, .swf, etc.\nDon't use spam trigger words and phishing phrases (WIN, Free!, etc.)\nMaintain a good text to image ratio - don't use an overwhelming number of images, or huge images\n\nSending Emails\n\nDon't buy lists of prospects. These lists have not been verified and will likely be inaccurate, which will contribute to your bounce limit. In addition, because you have not built a rapport with these individuals, they are more likely to mark you as spam. \nDon't email people who have repeatedly bounced. Hard bounces are a result of a mailbox being completely shut down. This can mean a few things, but the most common reason is that the email address no longer exists. As a result, these emails will never successfully deliver. If you have too many of these, your internet service provider (ISP) will reevaluate your email reputation, which will make it harder to get into others' inboxes. In addition, the abandoned addresses may have morphed into spam traps. Hitting even just one spam trap can cause deliverability problems.\nSend your emails from a recognizable name, or use your brand name to help with recognition. Prospects and customers are more likely to trust a personalized sender and email address (clark.kent@thedailyplanet.com instead of news@thedailyplanet.com)\nInclude your prospect or customer name in the To: field (Clark Kent) , rather than just having the email address (clark.kent@thedailyplanet.com). This shows spam filters that you know the person you're emailing.\n\nOngoing Best Practices\n\nAuthenticate your email with SPF, DKIM & DMARC\nMonitor your sender reputation. There are websites that will tell you if your mail server IP is listed on any popular Spam Blacklists. You can check your domain at the following resources: Sender Score, MX Toolbox, DNS Stuff\nCheck the content of your emails to see how they're ranked by standard spam filters with Mail Tester\nMonitor your email engagement metrics (opens, clicks, replies, bounces, and opt outs) and have a framework to pivot your strategy on based on the trends. If you start to notice negative trends, act quickly and make adjustments. If your open rates are declining, review your subject lines. If your reply rates are suffering, update the content of your emails.\nConsider slowing down the frequency of your email deliveries based on the engagement of your emails. Send to less engaged prospects and customers emails once a week instead of every day, and then maybe once a month if they trail off. When they do engage, you can start to increase the frequency of your communication. \n\nOutreach Safety Settings\nAdmin settings found under your Org's settings that can help avoid being marked as spam (screenshots below)\n\nDomain Level Throttling\nAbility to Disable Link Tracking\nDomain Level Safety Settings\nHard Bounce Limits - lockout rogue users for 24 hours\nRequire unsubscribe links\n\n \n \nControl the Message\nGovernance Profiles are an Admin setting to help limit your user permissions and control messaging that is delivered to your prospects.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n" .

As prospects move through a sequence step with an A/B test in it, Outreach randomly (but evenly) sends out a template to these prospects. For example: In an A/B test using 2 templates, your data will become valuable after at least 150 prospects have passed through the step. Any less than this will not allow you to see enough relevant data to make an informed decision on the quality of the message.\n\nA/B test where you want to improve\n\nBecause of how little effort goes into creating A/B tests for various message types, we recommend customers do it often and across all types of sequences. Constant testing and refining will lead to a deep understanding of your customers and the best language to address them going forward.\n\nTest either the open rate OR reply rate, but NOT both at the same time\n\nYou should only test open rate OR reply rate at one time to ensure you are getting the purest results.\nThe open rate of your email will correspond with the subject line. We recommend starting by A/B testing the open rate of your first email by changing the subject lines and leaving the body of the email the same. The reply rate will correspond with the body of the email. \n\nDon't test too many templates at once\n\nIf you are adding too many templates to your A/B test, it will take much longer to get valuable data.\n" .

By creating a picklist in Outreach, Admins can mirror the picklist validations in Outreach to any used in your CRM, ensuring data remains accurate and consistent for new values added to prospects and account fields.\nFor sales reps, picklists help you remember correct field names, and ensure they're logged correctly to match the ones in your CRM (i.e. Entering \u201chealth-care\u201d vs \u201chealthcare\u201d) - increasing efficiency and accuracy. \nNote: Picklist support can be used even if you don\u2019t use a CRM!

If these fields are syncing to a CRM, the Outreach picklist values must match the corresponding CRM values 1:1, including spacing and capitalization, to sync correctly. You can quickly add additional values by clicking \u201center\u201d after each entry. If you make a mistake, click on the trash can symbol to remove the incorrect picklist value.\nOnce you\u2019ve completed adding the picklist values, select \u201ccreate\u201d.\nOnce a picklist is created, the associated field will appear as a dropdown menu on each individual prospect and account.\n\nTo learn how to update existing prospect and account fields with the new picklist values, read this article.

        _:115002403693 <article> "Salesforce is a CRM created to store customer data while Outreach was designed to optimize the way sales teams sell. Since a CRM is an integral part of the sales process, Outreach works with Salesforce seamlessly to sync sales reps' activities and tasks back into the system of record (Salesforce).\nBuilding the Conflict Resolution Layer in Outreach's Salesforce Integration\nThe concept of a conflict resolution layer isn't found in many platforms. They typically decide one platform's data is more important than all others.  Without this layer, if changes are made in two platforms before a sync can occur, the hierarchy determines whose data wins. This means that data gets overwritten and you lose valuable information, and there\u2019s no going back from that.\nThe conflict resolution layer looks at both Outreach and Salesforce to see if updates were made in both locations. It acts as a middle layer that instantly compares both records. If there are updates in both platforms, the plugin ensures all updates are made so the data matches. It only updates the fields that have changed and never overwrites data that doesn\u2019t need to be updated. Your data deserves better. That\u2019s why Outreach has an intelligent layer to handle conflicting updates between Outreach and Salesforce based on they way your team makes updates to records.\nOutreach has created the most intelligent data conflict resolution in the game. You no longer need to worry about data entry overrides from the systems which feed Salesforce with data. Whether you are updating data in and out of Salesforce, only one direction, or interested in overriding blank fields, Outreach can accommodate. You can always trust that you\u2019re looking at the most up to date, accurate data, whether you\u2019re in Outreach or Salesforce.\n " .

        _:360021064393 <article> "Seamlessly connect your Intercom messages with your sequences in Outreach, so you can convert on more leads and move deals through the pipeline faster. By sending Intercom conversations to Outreach and triggering follow-up tasks, sequences and other activities in Outreach, connect all of the parts of your lead or customer\u2019s journey and automate the next best action for you to take as a salesperson.\n Note:  You need the same admin on both platforms (Intercom & Outreach) to enable the integration, and adding the Intercom integration is an org-wide action rather than a personal one for just one rep\u2019s account.\nThere are two sides to the Outreach & Intercom integration:\n\nGet Insights You Need from Sales or Support Conversations - See a full transcript of your Intercom sales or support conversations in your Outreach activity feed to provide the context you need before your next action\n\n\nTrigger Off of Intercom Messages - After you've chatted with your lead or customer on Intercom, use Outreach triggers to customize what happens next by triggering a sequence, task, call, and more!\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll explain how to enable the integration, how it works, and best practices for using the integration. \nEnabling the Integration\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform. On the setting panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cUser Admin\u201d and select \u201cOrg\u201d.\n\n\nScroll down the page until you find the section labeled \u201cIntercom Integration\u201d. Click \u201cLearn More\u201d\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be redirected to the Intercom integration installation page.\n\n\n\nClick install, then authorize on the pop-up. You\u2019ll be prompted to sign into Intercom, then authorize access to Outreach.\nYou\u2019ve successfully connected your Intercom account to Outreach! You now have the opportunity to configure more on Intercom\u2019s configuration page:\n\nEnable Intercom-branded events in your Outreach Activity Feed - If a prospect or customer with a corresponding email address in Outreach sends a message in Intercom, a \u201cNew Conversation\u201d will post in that prospect\u2019s activity feed in Outreach. Each Intercom chat message - from the prospect or from the rep - will then be posted as a line in your activity feed. If there is too much Intercom activity clogging up your activity feed, we\u2019d suggest unchecking \u201cInbound Messages\u201d and \u201cOutbound Messages\u201d so each individual message doesn\u2019t post to Outreach. A URL of the full transcript of the chat can be found on each event. Ensure you\u2019ve filtered in \u201cExternal\u201d activities in your Activity Feed. \nSetup Outreach Triggers to React to Intercom Events - By default, if a prospect or customer sends a chat through intercom, Outreach will keep the prospect/customer in any sequence they're in. To ensure that prospect\u2019s next step is contextual, you can trigger custom actions within Outreach so they don\u2019t continue in their current sequence unless desired. We recommend setting up a new trigger immediately to designate what should happen next after a Intercom event occurs.\n\n\n\n\nSave any changes.\nNow that you\u2019ve enabled the Intercom integration, Intercom will begin working automatically. A green check mark verifies that the integration has been successfully installed.\n\n \nNote: If the integration has already been enabled, you can always come back to this page to manage the Intercom app\u2019s settings. Instead of seeing the \u201cLearn More\u201d button, you\u2019ll instead see a button that\u2019s labeled \u201cManage App\u201d.\n \nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you\u2019ve enabled the integration, what do I need to do?\nShort answer: nothing! Intercom will post chat events to the Outreach activity feed. Once the app is installed, an email notification will be sent to all Outreach admins on your account.\n \n\n \nLong answer: set up your triggers. \nAfter a prospect or customer chats with you on Intercom, by default, nothing will change in Outreach. Triggers allow you to customize what happens to that prospect in Outreach after the chat finishes so the next step is contextual.\nNote: You will not see the Intercom trigger settings until you have set up the integration. You must also have admin access in Outreach to create triggers.\n\nIn Outreach, click on the initials on the bottom left hand side of the Outreach platform.\nUnder the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d select \u201cTriggers\u201d\nOn the top right hand side of the trigger list view page, select the blue \u201cAdd\u201d Button\nName your trigger. We recommend making it descriptive so that you can quickly glance at the name and understand what the trigger is accomplishing.\nUnder the Event section, you have three options. We'd highly recommend only triggering off of the \"Intercom - New Conversation\" event as it only occurs once somebody actually begins a chat with you. Triggering off of the specific messages creates far more noise than one trigger based on the conversation simply being initiated. \n\nIntercom - New Conversation: when a prospect engages with a chat (meaning they have to type something and send it)\nIntercom - Inbound Message: message sent by the prospect or customer in the Intercom chat\nIntercom - Outbound Message: message sent by the rep in the Intercom Chat Most customers utilize the \u201cIntercom- New Conversation\u201d event\n\n\n\n\nIn the \u201cProspect Conditions\u201d section, add conditions on the prospect that must be met for the trigger to fire. You also have the option to add account conditions.\nUnder trigger actions, decide what should be done when the Intercom event occurs and the prospect and/or account conditions are met.\nSave your changes and return to the trigger overview page and activate your sequence by clicking on the toggle next to the sequence game so that it turns green.\n\n \nExample Trigger\nEvent: Intercom - New Conversation\nTarget: Prospect\nProspect Conditions: Id (Outreach Internal), Is Not, Empty\nTrigger Action (#1): Action - Stop Sequences, Scope - Mark All Sequences Finished For Prospect\nTrigger Action (#2): Action - Create Task; Task - Action Item; Priority - High; Time Between Event And When Task Is Due - 0 Minutes; Task Note - Decide how to follow-up with the prospect after their Intercom conversation\nTrigger Action (#3): Action - Add Tags, Tags: IntercomChat\nFAQ\nWhy can\u2019t I see Intercom conversations in my Outreach activity feed? \nFirst, have you cleared the filters on your activity feed? If \u201cExternal\u201d events are checked/filtered in and you still aren\u2019t seeing your Intercom activity, contact Outreach Support.\n \nWhat triggers should I set up?\nEvery situation is different, but we recommend starting with more manual triggers until you know your process. For example, trigger an action item to decide how to follow up after your Intercom chat is over. Or trigger a follow-up sequence with the first step being a manual email, allowing you to decide on personalized messaging.\n \nHow do I differentiate between a sales and support Intercom conversation?\nWhether the Intercom chat was with your support team or with the sales team, an \u201cIntercom - New Conversation\u201d is fed into Outreach. There currently isn\u2019t a way to differentiate between the two from Intercom, except by reading the messages sent and received. That\u2019s why we recommend using generic, more manual triggers until you know your process. \n We\u2019ve seen customers utilize triggers to follow up on sales chats with prospects that didn\u2019t convert and on support chats with customers communicating on product issues. \n \nHow do I set up triggers of my Intercom events?\nSee our support docs for triggers here.\n " .

With Outreach, you can create a sequence or one-off task to remind you to text your prospect at the right time.\nSMS Task Overview\nCreating an SMS task is now included anywhere you can create a task in Outreach. When a task is created and nearing it\u2019s due date, the SMS task will appear in your 360 View and in the task overview page.\nWhen you click into the SMS task, you\u2019ll be automatically brought into the task flow. The task note can be found just above the compose window, which will help remind you what you need to text your prospect about.\n\nIf the prospect has more than one mobile number, you can select the correct number on the top of the page. Outreach will select the number based on the following criteria: \n\nDo you and prospect already have a conversation? If yes, use that number\nIf you and the prospect do not already have a conversation, does the customer have a mobile phone number specified? If yes, use the mobile number. \nIf 1 and 2 are false, Outreach will prompt you to specify a mobile number for the prospect.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve selected the correct phone number, you can compose your text by using the text field on the bottom of the task flow window. Write your message and click the \u201csend\u201d button to deliver the text. Once you\u2019ve received confirmation that the text was delivered successfully, you can mark the text as complete.\n\nSMS Tasks in Sequences\nAs noted above, SMS tasks can be added as a sequence task. In addition to creating an SMS task step, you have additional options in the sequence ruleset to mark a prospect as \u201creplied\u201d if you receive a text message from the prospect. \nNote: Prospects will be removed from sequence if you receive any text from them if the sequence ruleset setting is set to \u201cmark replied\u201d.\n\nClick on your initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform\nFind the section labeled \u201csystem config\u201d and select \u201crulesets\u201d.

        _:360008548474 <article> "The goal of a randomized controlled experiment, aka A/B test, is to scientifically identify and evaluate the impact of a change we want to make to a product or a process. For example, does the new email subject line, or call to action, or even an additional image or video in an email work better than the current one running. The result of an experiment is a precise measurement of increase or decrease in the metrics we care about caused by the change we were testing.\nThe key idea behind an experiment is extremely simple and is illustrated in the figure below, using the example of testing a new email subject line. Every prospect who is supposed to receive the email is randomly assigned one of the two variants: the current subject line, or the new subject line. We run the experiment for a few weeks, then compute metrics of interest i.e open rate, reply rate, etc. for each of the two subject lines. We then perform a statistical test, and if the test shows that a certain metric is different between the two groups in a statistically significant way, we can conclude that this difference was caused by our new subject line.\n\nExperiment design to evaluate the impact of a new e-mail subject line\nTo maximize your chances of identifying the winner, try bigger changes which are likely to matter, rather than small tweaks, and run your experiments on sequence steps with more traffic.\nRunning Email Experiments in Outreach \nSetting up a new experiment in Outreach is easy.  \n\nGo to the sequence page in Outreach\nIdentify the sequence and the email step in that sequence where you want to setup the experiment \nClone the email template, and click the clone to edit it. To get the most value out of the experiment, edit only one thing, e.g. one of the subject line, the call to action, the preview text, etc. but not all of them at the same time.\nTurn the new template on \n\nThe experiment is now running!\n\nWhile the experiment is running, you may see the following messages appear on the Sequences page in Outreach:\n\nThis means that the experiment is still collecting data needed for a statistical test.\n\nThis means that no statistically significant differences were detected. Wait longer, or if the experiment has already ran for longer than you planned, you can conclude that no large enough differences exist. You can stop the template you were testing and start another experiment on this step.\n\nThis means the experiment is invalid. You should not derive conclusions from it - for example if one template appears to be performing better it may be caused by the issues with setup and not be a true conclusion. There are two criteria we check for to ensure correctness of experiments. \n\nFirst, the number of emails sent to each variant should be about the same, with at least 150 emails in each variant. \nSecond, both templates should be active during the same consecutive period of time.\n\nIf you see this message, it means that one or both of these two requirements were violated. \n \n\nThis means that our statistical tests showed that the winning variant has statistically significantly higher reply rate than the losing variant. You can turn off the losing variant. You can click \u201cView Results\u201d to see the data used to determine the winner.  \n\nWarnings \nWhile the experiment is running, it\u2019s important to not make any changes to the sequence step and the templates involved in the experiment. Otherwise results of the experiment will become invalid. Outreach will warn you if you attempt a change that will affect any running experiment.  \n\nEditing a template or the subject line which is part of a running experiment makes the results difficult to interpret, since part of the results would be using one template or subject line and part of the results would be using another template. While Outreach will keep the experiment running, we recommend that you stop and restart the experiment cloning the sequence step and deleting the old step.\n\nTurning off the template will make the experiment invalid.\n\nTurning off sequence will make the experiment invalid. \nNotes \nNote that if you stop an experiment by pausing or deleting one of the templates, the messaging described above will go away. There is currently no place in Outreach to view historical experiments for which templates are not active or do not exist anymore (this feature is coming soon).\nAlso note that the messaging described above will only appear for experiments that involve exactly two templates. Using more than two templates is not a recommended practice due to fewer email going to each variant, requiring to run the experiment much longer. Therefore, guded template A/B testing is not available for more than two templates. If you want to evaluate three or more new options for the same email template, you can evaluate them one by one in two-template experiments.\n " .

        _:205083718 <article> "A/B testing is a the easiest way to test changes in your messaging against each other and determine which emails/templates produce the most positive results.\nIt is a method to validate that any new design or change to an email in your sequence is improving your open rate, click rate, or reply rate before you make that template the permanent option.\nTracking Open Rates vs. Reply Rates\nFor true A/B testing, you want to test either the open rate or the reply rate. Open rate is tracked by keeping the same email body, and only changing the subject of the email. Reply rate is tracked by having identical subject lines and modifying the body of the email. If modifications are made to both the subject and body of the email, it will not give a clear indication of whether the subject or body of the email prompted an open and reply to the email. For this reason, we suggest tracking either the open rate or the reply rate, but not both.\nCreating an A/B Test\n\nTo A/B test in Outreach, add the first template to your sequence step.\nEither click the \"+ Add Template\" link underneath the original template, or click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the template to easily clone the template for modifications:\n\n\nYou can add as many templates as you want for testing. Once you've added additional templates to the sequence step, you can modify either the subject line or body of the email. Changes can be made by clicking into the second template email. \nAdding Prospects\nWhen you add prospects to a sequence with A/B testing, you can either have Outreach automatically select which template the prospect receives, or you can manually select the template that you'd like to use. \nNote: selecting a specific template is only available for step #1 in the sequence. Any subsequence steps in the sequence with A/B testing will always automatically assign prospects to all available templates in roughly even volumes. \n\nIf you do not select a specific template, Outreach will randomize which template the prospects receive. Although it may appear that one template is being selected by the platform more heavily than the other, Outreach will continue to add prospects to both templates until they are even. For this reason, it is best practice to add at least 150 prospects to a sequence that you are A/B testing.\nMultiple Steps with A/B Testing\nAny sequence step that is an auto or manual email can utilize the A/B testing functionality. However, unlike the first step of the sequence, you will not be able to designate which template the prospects receive in the subsequent step. That is, if prospect A received template A in step one, they will not necessarily get template A on steps two, three, and four. Steps two, three, and four will randomize which template prospect A receives.\nTracking Performance\nAs prospects go through the sequence, you'll begin to notice one template performs better than the other.\nYou can track performance by looking at the template statistics on the right side of the sequence step. The report includes opens, clicks, and replies. Hovering over the template shows the number of prospects that opened, clicked, or replied. Otherwise the analytics show the percent of emails opened, clicked, or replied based on the total number of email deliveries for that specific template.\n\nYou can disable the template that isn't performing as well as the other by clicking on the green toggle next to the underperforming template. A disabled template is gray, rather than green. This ensures that your prospects only receive the most effective email template.\n\n \nMore Resources\n\nA/B Testing Best Practices\nGuided Template A/B Testing\n" .

Clicking this option allows you to filter the report by all Outreach users, \u201cyou\u201d, specific users, teams, and roles (if set up in Outreach).\n\nInterpreting Report Data\n Prospect Overview\nThe prospect overview shows the number of prospects created and/or mailed in the specified time period by the filtered users. You\u2019ll notice the numbers and graphs adjust as the date range and report profiles are changed.\nThe Prospects overview reports are broken down as follows based on the specified date range:\n\nCreated - The number of prospects created in the Outreach platform.\n\n\nMailed - The number of prospects that received at least one email in the specified date range. This number can be lower or higher than the number of prospects created, because not all prospects created will receive an email and/or prospects already in Outreach (previously created in the platform) may have received an email in this time frame.\n\n\nOpened - The number of mailings delivered that were opened by prospects. \n\n\nReplied - The number of mailings delivered that were replied to by prospects.\n\n\nBounced - Mailings sent from Outreach that were returned with a bounce notification email. You may see this number decrease, since some bounces automatically retry and are successfully delivered.\n\n\nUnsubscribed - The number or prospects that unsubscribed from future communication.\n\nOpens, replies, bounces, and unsubscribed data will appear as percentages. Hovering over the field will show you the specific number attached to these data points. You can click into these fields to view the list of prospects associated with the specific mailing state.\nDelivery Overview\nThe chart represents all emails delivered or scheduled over a specified period of time.  Of the delivered emails at that time, it shows how many went into a state of being opened, clicked, replied, or unsubscribed for emails delivered in the specific time frame.  To further clarify, the report captures unique prospect actions as they happen from the time of delivery. \nThese numbers are not necessarily associated with activity seen in the activity feed. For example, if an email was delivered to a prospect on March 4th, and the prospect replied on March 15th, the email reply would appear in the report during a date range that included March 4th, the date the email was initially delivered. This is also true of any opens, clicks, replies and opt-outs.\nThe Delivery Overview reports are broken down as follows based on the specified date range: \n\nDeliveries - The number of emails delivered to prospects. This can be higher than the number of prospects mailed, because some prospects may have been sent more than one email during the specified time period.\n\n\nOne-Offs - The number of deliveries that were sent as a single email. This does not include emails sent through bulk composes.\n\n\nSequences - Emails delivered as part of an email step in a sequence, either manual or automatic.\n\n\nClicks* - The number of mailings delivered that were clicked by the prospects.This will show as a percentage, but hovering over this number gives you a specific number.\n\n\nOpens* - The number of mailings delivered that were opened by the prospects. This will show as a percentage, but hovering over this number gives you a specific number.\n\n\nReplies - The number of mailings delivered that were replied to by the prospects.\n\n\nBounced - the percentage/number of emails that bounced.\n\n\nUnsubscribed - The number or prospects that unsubscribed from future communication.\n\n*Requires click tracking & open tracking are enabled in the template prior to delivery\nThe delivery overview graph can be sorted based on information that is most relevant to you. You can sort the graph by one-off emails, bulk emails, or sequences by selecting the options next to the delivery overview header. \nOnce sorted by the preferred option in the header, you can further adjust the graph to only view data points relevant to you. For example, if you only want to see deliveries, double click on the \u201cdeliveries\u201d section of the graph key, click once more to bring all data points back to the graph, and click a single time to remove the selection from the visible data points.\nCall Overview\nThe  Call Overview provides data for the number of calls placed to prospects in a specified date range by the specified individual(s), team, or role.\nFrom left to right you\u2019ll see the following based on the selected date range:\n\nCalls - The total number of calls placed\n\n\nOutbound - The number of calls logged that were outbound\n\n\nInbound - The number of calls logged that were inbound\n\n\nCall Dispositions (Vary) - Based on your org settings, you\u2019ll also see the call dispositions that were selected when calls were logged. These dispositions vary based on your org\u2019s protocols, but will be listed in this field with an associated percentage based on the total number of calls placed in the date range selected.\n\nCall dispositions are configured based on the outcome of a call. These dispositions are created by Outreach admins and is associated with an answered or unanswered call type. The call disposition determines how the prospect is treated within a sequence at the conclusion of the call. If the selected call disposition is associated with answered, the prospect will be removed from the sequence. If associated with unanswered, the prospect will continue to the next step of the sequence.\nSimilar to the delivery overview, you have the option to sort calls by all calls, outbound calls, or inbound calls. These options are found on the right of the Call Overview header.\nOnce sorted by the preferred option in the header, you can further adjust the graph to only view data points relevant to you. For example, if you only want to see deliveries, double click on the \u201cdeliveries\u201d section of the graph key, click once more to bring all data points back to the graph, and click a single time to remove the selection from the visible data points.\nLeaderboards\nLeaderboards let you see where you and your team stands and how your sequences and corresponding templates are performing.

The main symptom is robotic sounding audio.. \nPacket loss: Certain networks such as WiFi are prone to packet loss with the primary symptom being choppy audio. \n\nOutreach recommend the following best practice to avoid Jitter and Packet loss:\n\nEquip your reps with Ethernet when possible.\nReduce packet conflicts on WiFi by reducing the number of devices operating on the same channel and avoid large data file transfers over the same WiFi environment with voice.\nConfigure your router/firewall with QoS rules to prioritize the traffic on the ports 443 TCP and 10000-20000 UDP mentioned above.\nConfigure your router with QoS rule to prioritize the traffic based on the IP ranges mentioned above.\nIf using managed switches or certain routers/firewalls which support CoS, mark all Outreach Voice traffic with a DSCP of 46 (EF).\nAvoid bufferbloat. Bufferbloat builds up large queues that causes noticeable latency and bursts of jitter on a computer-based call.\nOutreach recommends configuring your router with a low buffer size around 100 ms or less.\n\nReduce latency\nLatency symptoms include call delays or people talking on top of each other. Callers typically start to notice the effect of latency once it breaches 250 ms for a \u201cmouth to ear\u201d trip, and above ~600 ms the experience is unusable.  \nThe codec algorithmic time, the jitter buffer, and the traversal time between Outreach servers to your network will always introduce some level of latency. The object is to minimize it and keep the total trip time below 300-400 ms for computer-based calls.\nStrategies to minimize Latency:\n\nSome lower bandwidth fixed internet connections can often have a higher latency. If possible, upgrade your internet connectivity.\nLTE (mobile 4G Data) and other cellular data solutions can often have high latency.\nConfigure QoS (as mentioned above). \n\nOther\nIf your router includes SIP Application Level Gateway (ALG) function or Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI), disable both these functions." .

        _:360003506553 <article> "Since our first ISO 27001 certification in 2015 to the many Outreach features that help enable our customers to meet their GDPR obligations - Outreach has your back! This article outlines the key principles and Outreach\u2019s recommendations to our customers to help you meet your GDPR obligations. You can visit our GDPR page and FAQ for more details on our recommendations for customers and what Outreach has done to comply with GDPR.\n The information contained in this article and on our website does not provide legal advice and should not be used as such. We recommend you consult with the appropriate legal counsel for that purpose.\nWhat is the GDPR? GDPR is a new set of data privacy regulations designed to harmonize various data privacy laws across the EU to create a common set of regulations for protecting EU residents\u2019 personal data. GDPR not only applies to companies that process the personal data of protected individuals, and have a presence in the EU (e.g. offices or establishments), but also to companies that do not have any presence in the EU but target the European market. Customers, including non-EU based customers, should carefully assess whether they are subject to the GDPR. If your company determines that you are subject to GDPR Outreach will provide you with our latest Data Processing Agreement (DPA) to satisfy the contractual requirements of GDPR.\nOutreach Security & Feature Updates for GDPR A core component of GDPR is ensuring that your data processors i.e. Outreach, implement security best practices for safeguarding personal data. Outreach already has a number of these security and privacy mechanisms in place. In addition, we have updated the Outreach platform to help you meet your GDPR obligations. \nKey highlights include:\n\nCompliance with key industry standards: ISO 27001 and U.S.-EU Privacy Shield framework\nBuilt-in support for encryption (in-transit and at-rest)\nOngoing penetration testing through our bug bounty program\nProduct features to control access to data on the Outreach platform includingGovernance and SSO\nProduct features to support data subject requests including selective CSV Export and Prospect data deletion\nFrom a marketing perspective, Outreach ensures that all EU users have opted-in to receive any correspondence from us and that they have the ability to delete their information at any time.\n\nData Controller vs. Data Processor Responsibilities: Finally, your company acts as the Data Controller of all data sent to Outreach for processing. Outreach is most likely just one of your Data Processors. In addition to the built-in capabilities mentioned above we have developed procedures to assist you in your Data Controller obligations regarding the handling of the personal data. \nPlease visit our GDPR page and FAQ for more details on our recommendations for customers and what Outreach has done to comply with GDPR." .

        _:206065197 <article> "Add Tags During an Import\nThere are two ways to add tags during the import process:\n\nAdd a column to your CSV file labelled \"Tags\" and map the \"Tags\" column to the \"Tags\" field in Outreach. You can add multiple tags to a prospect by listing each tag you're adding into the \"Tags\" cell for that prospect, making sure to separate each tag by commas. This allows you to add different tags to each prospect, if you'd like.\nYou can add the same tags to the entire list of prospects during the third step of the import process. Add multiple tags by hitting the enter button after each tag.\n\nThe steps for importing a CSV are outlined here.\nAdd Tags Within Outreach\n1. In the Prospects or Account list views, you can add or remove tags by selecting the tag icon towards the top of the screen.\n\n2. You can add multiple tags by clicking \"enter\" after typing each tag.\n\n3. After you have finished adding tags, you will see blue hyperlinks next to the prospects names. These are the tags you have created.\nSearch and Filter Using Tags\nThere are a few ways that you can search and filter for Prospects and Accounts by tags.\n1. You can click on the tag hyperlink to filter by that tag.\n\n2. Use the search bar and type in tags:\"Agriculture\" to filter all of the prospects with \"Agriculture\" as a tag.\n3. You can also search AND and OR statements, for example - tags:\"Agriculture\" AND tags:\"NY\" - This will result in all of the Prospects tagged for NY and the Agriculture industry.\n" .

        _:205744997 <article> "Assigning Stages in the sequence settings gives you visibility into where a prospect stands in a sequence and overall sales cycle.\nWhen are Stages Assigned?\n Outreach will automatically update the prospect's stage when a certain event takes place. These events are:\n\n\n\n\nAn email bounces\nA prospect opts out\nA prospect is first added to sequence\nThe first email is delivered or call completed\nA prospect replies to a sequence email or a User logs a call with an Answered dispositionNote: Depending on your Ruleset settings, booking a Meeting with a Prospect or receiving a reply to an SMS Message can also mark a Prospect as Replied\nA prospect is marked as finished with no reply\nProspect completes sequence, with no reply after a specified amount of time\n\nAs these events occur, the prospect stage will be updated. The prospect stage is a label that can be seen on the prospect's profile and throughout Outreach. These stages can be filtered, giving you the ability to quickly find prospects at a particular stage in the sales process.\n\n\n\nWhere can I add stage assignments?\nStage assignments can be assigned through the sequence ruleset or by triggers. To update your ruleset, you can do the following:\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nUnder \"System Config\" select \"Rulesets\".\nIf you have permission to make adjustments to rulesets, find the section labeled \"Update Prospect Stage When...\" and select the stage appropriate to the event that occurs.\n\n \nNote: Outreach provides boiler plate stage assignments. You can add new stages, delete stages, or edit existing stages by following these steps.\nStages and Salesforce: Salesforce statuses and Outreach stages must  match 1:1, including spacing and capitalization. For example, if a prospect replies to an email, their stage or status would update to the stage created in either Outreach or Salesforce. Additionally, you must use the exact string to map the Lead and/or Contact status between Outreach and Salesforce. You can learn more here." .

Field settings come out-of-the-box, but can be adjusted as needed.\n\nWhat happens if a prospect cancels or reschedules a meeting?\nIf a prospect uses your reschedule link to find a new time to meet, the change will sync back to Outreach and subsequently update the event in Salesforce. If a prospect declines or cancels a meeting, that change will only be reflected in Outreach.\nWill Meetings that have already been synced to Salesforce sync again and create duplicates?\nBefore a meeting is synced to Salesforce, Outreach looks for an event where the owner (assignee), subject, start & end time match. Of they match, Outreach considers this event a duplicate and will not sync to Salesforce. \nCan Meeting Attribution be synced to Salesforce [Beta]?\nYes! To sync Meeting Attribution information to Salesforce, you can now map the name of the related sequence in the plugin, allowing you to report on meetings booked in SFDC. Simply map the field \"Attributed Sequence Name\" from Outreach to a custom text field in SFDC on the Event Object.\n" .

        _:360007892853 <article> "Purpose:\nThe purpose of this article is to provide answers to Outreach users regarding commonly asked questions about Outreach's texting feature.\nFor more information on Outreach Voice and features, refer to the articles in the Outreach Voice.  \nNote: Outreach's Texting feature is currently under Beta testing; therefore, some features are not currently supported. When the feature clears beta testing, this article will be updated to reflect the applicable changes.  \nQ: How will I know if I've missed a text in Outreach?  A: There are three ways Outreach notifies you a text message is pending your review.  A red dot will appear over the message icon in the navigation sidebar.\n\n\n\nA number in parenthesis appears in the Outreach tab in your browser.\n\n\n\nIf enabled, you'll receive an email notifying you of an unread text message. This email includes a clickable link for quick reply.\n\n\n\nFor more information regarding configuring email notifications for missed text messages, refer to the How To Enable/Disable Missed Text Message Email Notifications article. \nQ: Will text messages appear in the activity history of the Prospect? What about my activity feed? A: Text messages appear in the activity history in the platform and in the extension. Text messages can also be seen on the Prospect Activity Overview.\nQ: Can I text more than one person at a time? A: Bulk messages and group chats are not currently supported. \nQ: Can I text non-US numbers, including Mexico and Canada? A: Texting can only be sent to and from US and Canada numbers. It is not available for other countries at this time.\nQ: Does Outreach support Multimedia Messaging (MMS) such as GIFs, Images, etc.? A: MMS messages cannot be sent through the Outreach texting feature; however, you can receive MMS messages.\nQ: Can my Prospects opt-out of receiving my text messages? A: If a Prospect opts out in Outreach via standard or granular unsubscribe, Outreach will block SMS messages to the Prospect and the Prospect's phone number.\nQ: Can a Prospect opt-out of receiving text messages by replying \"stop\" to a text message? A: If a Prospect replies to a text with STOP, STOP ALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, or QUIT, Outreach's SMS provider, Twilio, will prevent texting between the Prospect's number and the customer; however, Outreach does not automatically update the Prospect's opt-out status or prevent texting from other numbers to that Prospects number in Outreach. \nFor more information on Opt-Out options, refer to the Manual Prospect Opt Out article. \nQ: Can I include special formatting, such as hyperlinks, in my text messages? A: At this time special formatting is not supported in text messages sent from the Outreach platform.\n " .

        _:360023687473 <article> "This guide provides the step-by-step instructions to configure Outreach and Salesforce to create reports that answer the following business questions:\n\nWhich sequences influenced new opportunities created and won?\nWhich sequences influenced the most revenue?\n\nPrerequisites: \n\nYou should be an Outreach and Salesforce administrator, or have both individuals present\nMake sure Outreach is connected to Salesforce\n\nSatisfy the minimum requirements to connect Outreach to Salesforce\n\n\nEnsure Historical Trend Reporting is enabled in Salesforce.\nAdd a required lookup field in the Opportunity creation flow when the Opportunity is not created from a lead. \n\nInstall the Outreach Unmanaged Package in Salesforce\nPlease Note: Unmanaged packages are similar to open-source code, meaning the building blocks needed for the package are provided, but it is not supported by the package's author. Outreach provides this package for free, but due to the customizable nature of unmanaged packages, does not offer support for the package. More on unmanaged Salesforce packages here.\nIf you'd like to install the Outreach Unmanaged Package in your Salesforce Sandbox, please use the Sandbox Unmanaged package. If installing in your production environment, you can use the links included in the steps listed below. \n\nInstall the unmanaged package and ensure \"Do Not Install\" is selected for what to do when existing component names conflict with those in the Outreach package.\nSelect \"Install for All Users\". Note: If you do not yet have Historical Trend Reporting for Opportunities enabled, you will need to enable it in Salesforce.\nWait while the package components are installed.\nOnce installed, you'll see the below screen in Salesforce.\nThe Salesforce Admin will also receive an email.\nYou'll notice the following changes have been made:\n\nNew fields have been created on the Contact, Lead, and Opportunity objects (API name prefix: \"outreach_\")\n3 processes have been created in the Process Builder\nThere is a new report folder named \"Outreach\" with a pre-configured Opportunity report\n\n\n\n Add the Installed Fields to Page Layouts in Salesforce\nSalesforce Classic\n\nOn the top of the page select \"Setup\"\nOn the left-hand navigation panel, find the section labeled \"Build\" and select \"Customize\". New options will appear on the panel. Select \"leads\" and \"Page Layouts\"\nAdd the appropriate page layout(s). You'll find these fields all have the prefix: \"outreach_\". We recommend placing these fields under a section named \"Engagement Panel\".\n\nRepeat for all other required objects, such as Contacts (all of the aforementioned Engagement panel fields) and Opportunities (First Primary Contact Lookup field should be required).\n\nSalesforce Lightning\n\nOn the top right hand side of the Salesforce homepage, click on the gear icon and select \"Setup\"\nOn the top of the page, click on the \"Object Manager Tab\"\nFind \"Leads\" and select \"Page Layouts\" on the navigation panel.\nAdd the newly created fields to the layout. You'll find these fields all have the prefix \"outreach_\". We recommend placing these fields under a section named \"Engagement Panel\".\nRepeat for the Contact object (all of the aforementioned Engagement Panel fields).\nOn the Opportunity object, add the following fields:\n\nPrimary Contact Sequence - This field will list the Sequence name associated to generation of the opportunity.\nFirst Primary Contact Lookup - This should be set to required.\n\n\n\n*For Last Touch Sequence Attribution to work properly, the \"Current Sequence Name\" is copied onto the Opportunity from a Lead or a Contact. If your organization allows for the creation of Opportunities from any place other than the Lead record, this lookup is necessary and defines the main prospect who resulted in the opportunity. The \"Current Sequence Name\" is then subsequently transferred from this record onto the Opportunity. \nIf your organization already has a required field like this, feel free to modify the Process Builder to point to that lookup (see the FAQ details).\nMap Salesforce Lead-Level Fields to Like Contact and Opportunity-Level Fields\n\nIn Salesforce, find the Object Manger. Click into Leads and find \"Fields & Relationships\" on the left hand navigation panel. Select \"Map Lead Fields\" and map the lead-level Current Sequence Name field to the corresponding Contact-level field. This ensures that the data is not lost as Leads are converted into Contacts. \nMap the Lead-level Current Sequence Name field to the corresponding Opportunity-level field, \"First Primary Contact Sequence\".\n\nMap Outreach Engagement Fields to Corresponding Salesforce Fields\n\nIn Outreach, click on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Plugins\".\nClick into the lead object and, on the top of the page that appears, select \"fields\".\nAdd a new mapping and map \"Current Sequence Name\" in Outreach to the \"Sequence Name\" field in Salesforce.\n\nTest the Accuracy of Revenue & Pipeline Correlation Reports\n\nSelect an Outreach prospect that is synced with a Salesforce Lead or Contact.\nAdd the prospect to a sequence, and let them complete at least one sequence step.\nEnsure the engagement panel in the Salesforce record has synced, displaying engagement data for the most recently active sequence from above.\nCreate an Opportunity in Salesforce, and add the Contact to the Opportunity (or convert the Lead, then add it to the Opportunity).Move the Salesforce Opportunity to Closed/Won (or a similar stage).\nOpen the report located in \"All folders\" and find the folder labeled \"Outreach\". \nFind the report \"Revenue by Sequence\" and confirm the opportunity revenue has been properly attributed to the Outreach sequence. If you do not see data in the report, please see the FAQ found here.\n\nThis functionality only applies to Opportunities created moving forward, so depending on your organization, it may take some time to build a complete report.  The below screenshot is an example of a complete report:" .

        _:221361788 <article> "Triggers are an extremely powerful admin feature in Outreach that allow you to automate action in Outreach.\nParts of a Trigger\n1. Trigger Event\n\nThe trigger event determines when a trigger should take action. Trigger events include:\n\nProspect Created - A net new prospect is created in Outreach. This can be creation through a CSV, Salesforce Report, single Salesforce import, or manual prospect creation in the Outreach platform. You can specify a time offset if the Trigger should fire after the Prospect has been created.\nProspect Updated - A prospect record is updated. \nProspect Created or Updated - Includes characteristics from both \"Prospect Created\" and \"Prospect Updated.\"\nOpportunity Created - A net new opportunity is created in Outreach. This can be creation through a CSV, Salesforce Report, single Salesforce import, or manual opportunity creation in the Outreach platform. You can specify a time offset if the trigger should fire after the close date occurs, which will be checked on a reoccurring 15 minute cadence.\nOpportunity Updated - An opportunity record is updated. \nOpportunity Close Date - Indicate when the trigger should fire based on the close date set for the opportunity. You can specify a time offset if the trigger should fire before or after the close date occurs, which will be checked on a reoccurring 15 minute cadence.\nAccount Created - A net new account is created in Outreach. This can be creation through a CSV, Salesforce Report, single Salesforce import, or manual account creation in the Outreach platform. \nAccount Updated - An account record is updated. \nAccount Created or Updated - Includes characteristics from both \"Account Created\" and \"Account Updated.\"\nEmail Delivered - A trigger will fire when an email is delivered to a prospect.

This includes inbound and outbound dials.\nMeeting Booked - \"Meeting Booked\" triggers fire when a meeting is booked and meets all set meeting conditions. \nMeeting No-Show - A trigger will fire when a meeting is marked as a \"no-show\" and meeting conditions are met.\n\n\n2. Trigger Target\n\nThe trigger target is the object the trigger actions should apply to and update. This field will update to include the any available options depending on the trigger event chosen above. \n\nProspect - Trigger actions will apply to the prospect that matches the trigger conditions. \nAll Prospects (For Opportunity) - Trigger actions will apply to all prospects on the opportunity that matches the trigger conditions. \nPrimary Prospect - Trigger actions will apply to the primary prospect on the opportunity that matches the trigger conditions. \nProspect Roles - Trigger actions will apply to the all prospects with a specific role on the opportunity that matches the trigger conditions. \nOpportunity - Trigger actions will apply to the opportunity that matches the trigger conditions. \nAll Prospects (For Account) - Trigger actions will apply to all prospects in the account that matches the trigger conditions. \nAccount - Trigger actions will apply to the account that matches the trigger conditions. \n\n\nTrigger only once per target\n\nWhen this setting is enabled, this trigger will only fire once for each target that matches the conditions. The trigger will continue to fire when new targets that match the conditions are added. \n\n\n\n3. Trigger Conditions\n\nConditions can be applied to Prospects, Accounts, Calls, Meetings, and Opportunities in Outreach depending on the trigger event chosen above. Conditions outlined in the trigger must be met before the trigger fires. Conditions are built from fields that exist on the specific record indicated. Examples prospect conditions include \"Title contains VP\" or \"Opt Out is not false\"\n\nNote: Conditions can be created to include \"any\" or \"all\" conditions, and grouped together as appropriate. Multiple conditions and actions can be added to the trigger settings. Click the word \"any\" or \"all\" to switch between these two options. \n4. Trigger Actions\n\nThe trigger action is the specific action taken on the trigger target when the trigger event has happened and the prospect/account conditions are met. These will vary depending on the trigger target chosen above.\nActions include:\n\nAdd to Sequence - When the trigger conditions are met, add the prospects to a specific sequence.\nSet Field - When the trigger conditions are met, update a specified field with a value or string  \nStop Sequences - When the trigger conditions are met, either mark all sequence as finished or select specific sequences prospects should be removed from.\nCreate Task(s) - When the trigger conditions are met, create a task. Tasks can include calls, manual emails, a meeting, LinkedIn actions, and an SMS task.\nAdd Tags - When the trigger conditions are met, add the specified tags to the trigger target. \nRemove Tags - When the trigger conditions are met, remove the specified tags from the trigger target. \n\n\nNote: The trigger will perform any actions in the order they are listed. \nCreate a Trigger\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.

        _:360002695553 <article> "Advanced Task Mapping lets you ensure that specific data points from activities created and completed in Outreach are carried over into specific fields in your Salesforce activity logs. This is helpful for Sales Managers and Salesforce Admins to run reporting in Salesforce on open or completed activity within Outreach.\nOnce you have contacted Outreach support to turn on this functionality within your Outreach instance, you will see three new objects listed in your plugin type\u2019s menu: Salesforce Tasks <> Outreach Calls, Salesforce Tasks <> Outreach Mailings, and Salesforce Tasks <> generic Outreach Tasks. You'll find more details, including setup steps, on each object later in the support documentation.\nWith Advanced Task Mapping enabled, you can: \n\nMap to custom fields on the task object instead of the activity history\nPush prospect engagement data to fields on the prospect record\nConsolidate events (number of opens, clicks)\nGranularly configure how activities are posted to SFDC\n\nAdvanced Task Mappings are used to ensure that specific data points from activities created and completed in Outreach are carried over into specific fields in your Salesforce activity logs. This is helpful for Sales Managers and Salesforce Admins to run reporting in Salesforce on open or completed activity within Outreach. \nSetting up Advanced Task Mappings\nOnce you have contacted Outreach support to turn on this functionality within your Outreach instance, you will see three new objects listed in your plugin type\u2019s menu: Salesforce Tasks <> Outreach Calls, Salesforce Tasks <> Outreach Mailings, and Salesforce Tasks <> Generic Outreach Tasks. Please find more details on each object later in the support documentation.\n\nDefining Sync Options\nWhen you click into any of the Task objects in the Salesforce plugin, we suggest enabling the following options:\n\nPushing - Automatically push tasks from Outreach to SFDC\nOutbound Create - Permission to create new tasks in SFD\nOutbound Update - Allows open tasks to be marked as completed in SFDC upon task completion in Outreach\nAutomatically Associate Activity with Opportunity (optional) - Associate the task with the most recent opportunity\n\nPolling and Inbound Update are not used or necessary on the customizable activity mapping, since all task creation and updates will be made in Outreach and pushed to Salesforce.   \nNote: Tasks created in Salesforce will not be polled into Outreach, even if the polling option is enabled. Similarly, tasks created in Outreach and pushed to Salesforce cannot be marked as complete in Salesforce and updated in Outreach. Tasks will need to be marked complete in Outreach to update appropriately in Salesforce. \nDefining Field Settings \nField settings determine which fields on the Salesforce task should be updated by Outreach. The available fields differ based on the task type that is mapped in the Salesforce plugin. Full field settings for each task type can be found in the support documentation for each task type. \nEach task type will already have the standard Salesforce mappings created. However, custom templates are available for use if an Outreach field does not exist or does not match the corresponding Salesforce field that you\u2019d like to map.\n " .

        _:360000264933 <article> "Personas are a way to classify your prospects based on similar attributes, so you can more effectively communicate with them. Marketing teams have been using personas for decades to effectively track customer cohorts for optimizing marketing efforts. And now, sales teams can harness the same power to track what language, communication channels, and timing is most effective by persona.\nPersonas will play a big part in your sales process in addition to all the fields you use to get the demo and close that deal.\nCommunicating With Different Personas\nIt's important to understand the preferred personas for each audience segmentation for tailoring sequences to the ways prospects prefer to be communicated with. These personas are a result of connecting the dots by understanding their industry, vertical, title, and where they are geographically. Weaving those all together will then allow you to craft the persona.\nFor example, a VP of Sales in a SaaS company may not play the same role as a VP of Sales in a manufacturing company. Understanding how your product can be the solution with your audience is important in crafting your personas. It's\nAs a SaaS company you may want to set up personas as follows:\n\nC-Level | Tech and security | USA\nC-Level | Tech and security | Europe\nTier 3's | SDR | Tech and security | USA\nTier 3's | SDR | Tech and security | Europe\nTier 3's | BDR | Tech and security | USA\nTier 3's | BDR | Tech and security | Europe\nTier 3's | AE | Tech and security | USA\nTier 3's | AE | Tech and security | Europe\n\nPersonas are an incredible way to segment the prospects in your accounts for account-based sales. As a general rule of thumb, when determining what your personas should be, you should start simple. Think about four to five persona segments that you commonly target in your sales efforts.Then, think about the titles and roles that would segment them, and set your triggers up to reflect this.\nCreating Outreach Personas\nPersonas can be created and modified by Outreach within prospect customization settings on your left-hand navigation.\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of Outreach\nOn the settings panel, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Prospects\"\nOn the top of the page, click on \"Personas\"\nTo add a new persona, click \"Add\" on the top right hand corner of the page.\nAdd the title of the persona and include a description of what that persona entails \n\nApply Personas to Prospects\nOnce you've created Persona labels, you can apply them to prospect in bulk.\n\nOn the prospect listview page, sort/filter your prospects until you have a list of prospects that meet the conditions of one of your personas.\nSelect the prospects and on the top of the page, click on the paper and pencil button.\nOn the dropdown menu, select \"Persona\" and select the correct persona from the dropdown menu.\nApply your changes. The prospects will have an orange tag next to their name/title that contains the persona name.\n\nSearch for Prospects with a Specific Persona\nOnce personas have been applied to prospects, you can use the sort & filter drawer on the prospect listview page to find prospects with a specific persona label and add them to a corresponding sequence. \n\nCreating Persona-Specific Triggers\nBy combining the title and persona fields, you can create a trigger to auto-assign personas. Below is an example of how you'd set up a trigger to automatically assign a persona to a prospect that is created or updated and does not yet have a persona assigned.\n\n \nImportant Note\nWhen communicating with prospects it's good to remember that we want to get as close as we can to the right persona in order to convey the right messaging. That involves knowing the titles of who you need to target and how craft that message. " .

Below we go over the email analytics charts, so you can better understand the information that's being surfaced by Outreach. \nEmail Analytics\nBest Time to Email by Reply Rate - The heat map shows the best time to email based on the number of replies received by a prospect. Similar to the other heat maps, darker purple indicates a higher reply rate during the specified day and time, with the best time to email each day noted on the top of the heat map. Time zone is taken into consideration. If someone on the East Coast emails a prospect at 9am and the prospect replied, the user located on the West Coast would surface the reply as 6am. The bottom 1% is not included in best time to email suggestions because there is not enough activity to make the suggestion.\n\nEmail Delivery by Mailing State - This graph breaks down the mailing state based on the total number of emails delivered in the specified date range, as well as the type of delivery (sequence email, one-off, bulk compose). You can adjust the graph to only view data points relevant to you. For example, if you only want to see deliveries, double click on the \u201cdeliveries\u201d section of the graph key, click once more to bring all data points back to the graph, and click a single time to remove the selection from the visible data points. This graph can be viewed by day, week, or month.\n\nMailing Leaderboard - Broken down by either team, users, or roles, the chart provides insight into the number of deliveries by group or individual and the percentage of opens, clicks, and replies. The top of the chart shows the total number of deliveries and breaks down how the mailings were delivered, either by sequence, bulk, or one-off emails.\n\nOutbound Email Activity by Time of Day - This heat map shows email activity broken down by day and time. The darker purple indicates more activity, and lighter purple indicates less activity. The top days and times of activity are displayed at the top of the chart. You can hover over each individual square for information on the number of emails delivered and the percentage of activity during that time period.\n\nTemplate Leaderboard - This chart shows the top performing templates, breaking down the total deliveries by opens, clicks, and replies. The top of the chart provides overall statistics for how your team's templates are performing.\n\n To find these charts, follow the steps in this article." .

With ReachOut you can:- Access direct phone numbers and email addresses- Integrate B2B data into your existing LinkedIn and Salesforce workflows- Gain valuable company insights while browsing corporate websites- Save time and shorten the sales cycle\n \nUsing ReachOut\nTo add a new lead, simply click on the Reach Out Chrome Extension on the page where the lead exists. If the lead is located in ZoomInfo\u2019s database, a preview of their information will appear. Click on \u201cget contact info\u201d to reveal the lead\u2019s contact information.\n  \nIf ZoomInfo does not have the lead phone number, they will display (HQ), indicating the number belongs to the company headquarters. \nOnce revealed, you\u2019ll have the option to export the prospect to Salesforce, Outreach, or email them directly. Each of these actions will cost one credit.\n \nIn addition to contact data, ReachOut also provides information about the company where your contacts work. At a glance, you can view company size, revenue, industry, and a brief description.  \nFor more information, click \u201cFull Company Info.\u201d This will open a new page inside ZoomInfo Pro displaying the company\u2019s profile.\n  \nExporting to Salesforce\nIf you have not already connected your Salesforce account to ZoomInfo, you will be prompted to enter your Salesforce credentials and security token before the lead exports. \n \nYou must then go back to the ReachOut tool, click \u201cGet Contact Info\u201d again and then click \u201cSalesforce\u201d to complete the export.\n \nIf you have already connected your Salesforce account, the export will launch upon the click of the \u201cSalesforce\u201d button and you will receive a message letting you know the action was successful.\nContact information exported from ReachOut to Salesforce will enter your database as a new lead. If they are a contact, they will need to be manually converted in Salesforce.\nPro Tip: We recommend setting up deduping rules in SFDC to prevent the creation of duplicate leads in Salesforce. Outreach will continue to dedupe based on unique IDs, and will not create an additional prospect in the platform if the email matches a prospect that already exists.\n \n Exporting to Outreach\nSimilar to exporting to Salesforce from a public profile, exporting to Outreach is as simple as clicking a button (literally). As long as you are logged into your Outreach account, there are two steps you need to take. Find the lead that you\u2019re interested in and select the option to export:\n \nIf the lead is successfully exported to Outreach, a message will appear at the bottom of the ReachOut window\n \nIf the lead already exists in Outreach, the action will fail with an error message indicating that we prevented a duplicate prospect from importing to Outreach.\n \nUsing ReachOut in Salesforce to Export to Outreach\nSimilar to Outreach\u2019s Chrome Extension, ReachOut can be used to export leads and contacts to Outreach. Simply open ReachOut on the lead, contact, or account that you\u2019re interested in and select the option to export to Outreach:\n \nPro Tip: We recommend using Outreach\u2019s Chrome Extension in Salesforce. With Outreach, you can take action as soon as the lead, contact, or account is imported. With ReachOut, you\u2019ll need to find the imported object in Outreach before you can take action.\nQuestions?\nCheck out ZoomInfo's support documentation.\nConnecting Outreach & ZoomInfo\nHow to Export to Outreach" .

        _:205022518 <article> "Outreach has a hard limit of 5000 mailings per week per user on a rolling basis. There are a number of reasons for this limit, including ensuring your org's domain stays healthy and isn't blacklisted for spamming.\nMailbox Email Limits\nLimits for Gmail can vary based on the type of account and how the Gmail account has been in use, so it is important to understand your limit if you choose to email in large volume. Exchange or Office 365 limits are typically set internally.\nListed below are the different types of limits and where you can find them in the Outreach platform. \nMailbox Limits\nAll Outreach users can limit the number of emails that can be sent from any one mailbox.\nEdit the Sending Limits from Your Mailbox\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform. On the top of the page, select on \"Mailboxes\".\nClick \"Edit\" next to the mailbox that needs adjustments.\nOn the top of the page, select \"Advanced.\nFind the section titled \"Send Settings\" and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThe types of mailbox limits include:\n\nMaximum emails this mailbox can send per day/week from within Outreach\nMaximum emails a mailbox can send per day from inside and outside of Outreach\n\nInside Outreach includes emails that are delivered from within the Outreach platform as well as while using the Gmail Chrome Extension or Outlook Add-In. Emails outside of Outreach are emails sent from the individual's inbox without the Chrome Extension or Add-In enabled.\n\n\n\nThere is also an adjustable throttle that allows you to select the timeframe over which the throttle applies. In the timeframe drop-down, the options are \"Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years.\"\n\nThis setting is set to throttle 10 emails per minute by default as this is a common limit for email servers, such as Gmail, to have in place. You can see other such limits in our mailbox limits article. \nNote: Unlike global or mailbox limits, throttle limits will only affect the specific sequence they are applied in. You can learn more in the throttle support article." .

Including note and reminder variables allow you to personalize your template for manual email steps, and prevents the email from delivery without an update from you.\nIf your variables are not highlighted at all, one of your variables has something wrong, usually a typo. Outreach will automatically fail any content with broken variables as a safety setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Remove Formatting \nWhen copying and pasting content into templates, fonts and text formats may differ.

Sending allows Outreach to use your mailbox for email delivery. Syncing allows Outreach to talk to your mailbox, so every time you engage with a prospect, we capture information and pull it into Outreach to take the appropriate action.  Are they active in a sequence? If so, Outreach will pull the prospect out of the sequence so they do not continue to receive follow-up emails. \nEnabling Sending & Syncing\n1. Find your mailbox settings by clicking your initials or picture on the bottom left side of your screen. Navigate to your mailbox.\n\n2. Select \"edit\"\n\n \n3. Under your mailbox settings, your toggles will be disabled (grey)\n\n4. To enable sending and syncing, click on each toggle so that they turn green. \n\n 5. Don't forget to hit save!" .

        _:360001436193 <article> "Q: Will enabling SSO for Outreach cause any problems for those that have already logged in via email/password?\nA: Enabling SSO while some users are currently logged in shouldn't invalidate their sessions immediately.  Currently logged in users will simply need to log back in as soon as their current session times out, and the new login will be via their SSO provider.  There should be no disruption, assuming users are already familiar with logging in with SSO. \nQ: Does Outreach support provisioning a license through our SSO provider if we run out of licenses? For example, when a new sales rep joins the team and they log in to our SSO provider for the first time, what happens if we are out of Outreach licenses?\nA: You won't be able to add licenses via SSO.  If you have the additional licenses already, you can auto-provision seats through your SSO provider, but we'll need your explicit permission to add additional seats to your subscription overall.\nQ: If our SSO provider went down, can we sign into Outreach without using SSO (ie via the Outreach website)?\nA: Once SSO is enabled, it becomes the only way to access your org's Outreach seats.  In the unlikely event that your SSO provider goes down, you would need to contact your CSM or the Outreach support team to have them disable SSO for your org, at which point all users who need to log in would need to create a new password and use that to log in." .

        _:204660158 <article> "\nOutreach uses API calls to communicate and sync records to and from Salesforce. The number of API calls used varies depending on the following factors:\n\nIs the data coming inbound from Salesforce into Outreach?\nIs the data being sent outbound from Outreach to Salesforce?\nDo the records being synced also have relationships that have not been previously synced?\n\nSyncing Data from Salesforce to Outreach (Inbound)\nIf the data is coming from Salesforce into Outreach, Outreach can detect up to 2,000 unique Salesforce records in one API call, and can import up to 200 records in 1 API call. Polling takes place every few seconds to every few minutes, depending on your preferences, so the number of records brought down in a single API call can vary depending on the number of updates that have been made in Salesforce.\nExample: If 2000 Lead objects are created in Salesforce, only 1 API call will be consumed to detect all 2000 Lead objects, and then 10 API calls will be used to bring this data into Outreach in batches of 200 records at a time, for a total of 11 API calls used.\nSyncing Data from Outreach to Salesforce (Outbound)\nIf the data is sent to Salesforce from Outreach, one API call is made to Salesforce to update a corresponding record every time there is an update to the record in Outreach.The intention is to keep the synchronization process as close to real time as possible. If the same record is changed multiple times in quick succession, all of those updates are batched into a single API call.\nExample: If 100 Prospects are created within Outreach. 100 API calls will be used to synchronize this data with Salesforce.\nSynchronizing Relationships Between Records\nOutreach also supports syncing relationships between records in real time. If at any time during the inbound or outbound sync process, a relationship is encountered that does not exist in either system, one additional API call is made to ensure that relationship has been synchronized\nExample: If 100 Contact objects are created in Salesforce that are also associated with Account objects that are not in Outreach, 1 API call will bring in all 100 Contacts, and 100 additional API calls are used to bring in all the associated Account objects. Total: 101 API calls.\n\n \nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How many API calls am I already using?\nA: After connecting Outreach to Salesforce, an Administrator will be able to see how many total API calls have been used on that day in the Limits section of your Salesforce plugin inside Outreach.\nOnce your Salesforce plugin is connected, click on your initials on the bottom left hand side of the screen. On the Settings panel, select \"Plugins\". Click into the plugin and on the top of the screen select \"Limits\".\nThe global API call usage tells you how many API calls are used by all apps connected to Salesforce that require API calls. The Outreach-specific API call usage determines how many API calls are being used specifically by Outreach. \n\n \nQ: How do I limit Outreach's API call usage?\nA: You can reference this article to learn more about how to limit API call usage.\nAn Outreach Admin can set the maximum number of API calls Outreach can perform per day by designating the Outreach-specific or global API call threshold. When the API call threshold is met, the Outreach plugin will no longer push updates to Salesforce or poll updates into Outreach from Salesforce. Updates and activity syncs will be retried 3 times in a 24-hour period (once every eight hours). If the call threshold does not drop below the limit during these 24 hours, the activity sync will not be retried.\nQ: How can I view API call usage in Salesforce?\nA: See below for viewing API usage in Enterprise vs Professional editions\nFor Enterprise/Unlimited Editions \nFrom the main Salesforce page, click on Reports > Administrative Reports > API Usage - Last 7 Days.\n\nFor Professional Edition\nFrom the main Salesforce page, click on Setup > Monitor > System Overview > API Usage.\n\nQ: How do I get more API calls?\nA: API calls are purchased through Salesforce. If you'd like to increase the amount of API calls available to your org, you can reach out to your Salesforce Account Executive to discuss your options. If you increase the number of API calls available for use, the change will be reflected in Outreach under your Salesforce limits." .

        _:360000113693 <article> "Outreach uses API calls to transfer data from Outreach to Salesforce and vice versa. If you have been hitting your API limit recently and are interested in learning about how to reduce your Outreach API call usage, please read on.\n Inbound API Call Usage\n\nReduce Polling Frequency\n\nThe more often we poll Salesforce for changes, the more API calls Outreach will use.\nReduce the polling frequency and you'll see a reduction in the amount of API calls used. Note: The polling frequency is set to 10 minutes out of the box.\n\n\nCreate Polling Conditions\n\nAdding polling conditions will limit the amount of records we check for changes in Salesforce, which will limit API call usage.\nThe example in the screen shot below would only poll Salesforce for leads who have an Account Owner.\n\n\nOnly Map the Fields You Need in Outreach\n\nReducing the amount of field mappings on leads, contacts, and accounts will transfer less information, using less API calls as a result.\n\n\nOnly Bring in Necessary Prospects into Outreach\n\nIf you don't plan on working the lead in Outreach, then there's no need to bring that lead or contact into the platform. You can add conditions on \"inbound create\" to prevent against having unnecessary prospects in the platform.\n\n\n\nOutbound API Call Usage\n\nLeave Message Opens/Clicks Off\n\nEach open/click will push 1 new activity to the lead/contact's activity feed and uses 1 API call each time. It's more user-friendly to view this information in Outreach and it will save your API calls to have this disabled on the lead/contact sync settings.\n\n\nConditions on Outbound Create (or not on at all) \n\nIf this is part of your workflow, leave it on.\n\n\n\nEach time there is a change to a mapped field in Salesforce, Outreach will notice the change during the polling cycle. If you can reduce the amount of updates that occur on the lead/contact/account objects in Salesforce, you will reduce the amount of API calls used when we pull this changed data into Outreach.\nTo learn more about how API calls are used in Outreach, please read this article on Understanding API Call Usage." .

Shared sequences are visible and can be used by the entire organization, while private sequences are only accessible by the owner.\nSharing Sequences\n\nFrom the home page, click on the sequence option in the left hand navigation panel. If the navigation panel is expanded, this will appear as a paper airplane icon. If the navigation panel is condensed, sequenced will be nested under the book icon.\nSelect the sequence you'd like to adjust and navigate to the settings tab of the sequence.\nChange the share type to \"Others can see and use it\".\n\nThis setting will allow other Outreach users to put their prospects in the sequence." .

        _:205107348 <header> "Sequence Throttle" .
        _:205107348 <article> "Throttles can help to stagger the volume of prospects moving through a sequence at one time, protect you from hitting your email provider's mailing limits, and can also help users iterate more quickly when A/B testing. \nIn addition to controlling the amount of emails that go out each day, you want to make sure that you give yourself breathing room to follow up.  Throttling will make sure that you're able to have breathing room to give each person who responds an appropriate follow up. \nTo find your sequence throttle, click into any sequence. Click on the sequence settings, which can be found as an option next to the master sequence toggle on the top of the sequence page.\n\nNote: Regardless of your throttle settings, prospects will first appear in a pending state. They will be added to the sequence based on the options you select.\nThrottles for Sequences by Step Interval\nIf you are using a step interval sequence, you have a few throttle options. \nSequence Throttle Setting Options\n\nProspect Throttling: Do you want to limit the number of prospects that can be added to the sequence?\n\nEnabled - The number of prospects that can be added to the sequence should be limited. This is the default setting.\nDisabled - The number of prospects that can be added to the sequence is not limited. They will be added to the first step immediately, and activated for delivery based on the sequence schedule.\n\n\n Auto-Activate Prospects (if Prospect throttling is enabled): Should Outreach add prospects to the first step of the sequence on your behalf?\n\nYes- activate based on throttles - Outreach will look at the number selected in step 3 and 4, limiting the number of prospects activated and added the appropriate number of prospects to the first step of the sequence. This is the default setting.\nNo - leave prospects in pending - Prospects will not be automatically added to the first step of the sequence. They\u2019ll stay in a pending state until manually moved to the first step for action.\n\n\nMax active prospects per user: How many prospects can be active in the sequence at once?\n\nThis number determines the maximum number of active prospects there can be in the sequence at a given time. \n\nEx: If this setting is limited to 50 max active prospects per user, I may be able to add 100 prospects to the sequence, but only 50 of those prospects can be actively moving through the sequence at once. As prospects finish or exit the sequence (they reach the last step or reply), more prospects are activated until 50 prospects are active in the sequence.\n\n\n\n\nMax adds per user every 24 hours: How many prospects can be activated and added to step 1 of the sequence every 24 hours?\"\n\nThis number determines the maximum number of prospects that can be activated and added to the first step of the sequence every 24 hours. This setting checks the setting in step 3, \u201cMax Active Prospects Per User\u201d before taking action.\n\nLet\u2019s say you limit the max adds per user setting to 50 prospects every 24 hours, but then add 200 prospects into the sequence. On the first day, 50 prospects will be active in the first step in the sequence. The remaining 150 prospects will stay in a pending state. 24 hours later, 50 additional prospects are added to the sequence, and 100 prospects will stay in a pending state. This pattern repeats every 24 hours until there are no more prospects to add to the sequence.  \n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the two throttle settings work together? \nIf both throttle settings have limits, Outreach will check the number of prospects that are already active in your sequence. If you have not reached your maximum activation limit, pending prospects will be activated and added to the sequence until the max activation threshold is met. \nLet\u2019s assume the max active prospects per user is 200 and the max adds every 24 hours is 175  prospects. If there are only 150 active prospects in the sequence, Outreach will activate and add 50 additional prospects to meet the maximum of 200 active prospects per user. This check will be continuous, looking first at the maximum active prospects threshold, then adding the appropriate number of prospects to the sequence, until there are 200 prospects active in the sequence or the 24 hour maximum is met.\nIn both cases, any prospects that are not active will stay in a pending state.\nThrottles for Sequences by Exact Date/Time\nIf you are creating a sequence with steps by an exact date and time, you still have the option to add a throttle. The throttle will determine the maximum number of prospects that can be added to the sequence. \n\nTo find your sequence throttle, click into any sequence.\nClick on the sequence settings, which can be found as an option next to the master sequence toggle on the top of the sequence page.\nFind the section labeled \"Throttle Newly Added Prospects\" and enter the maximum number of prospects that can be added to the sequence.\n\nNote: If you try to add more prospects to the sequence than the throttle allows, you'll receive an error that says, \"Max activations exceeded\". You'll need to increase this number before you can add additional prospects to the sequence. " .

        _:360001394973 <article> "Exchange Impersonation is a configuration through which companies can set up a master service account(s), that can access individual user mailboxes. When using Exchange Impersonation to send a message, the email appears to be sent from the mailbox owner. The benefit of using this method is that individual users do not need to provide Outreach with their email username and password. Instead, we\u2019d only require credentials to the service account, which in turn grants access to the individual mailboxes. To learn more about Exchange Impersonation, follow this link. \nNote: Outreach supports Exchange 2010+ for Impersonation. At this time, alias emails cannot be connecting through a Master service Account.\nAdding an Exchange Master Service Account to Outreach\nTo set up the Exchange Master Service Account in Outreach, you\u2019ll need to have an Outreach admin and the individual within your organization with the Master Service Account Credentials. \n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cUser Admin\u201d and select \u201cOrg\u201d.\nFind the section labeled \u201cMailbox Setup\u201d and click on \u201cExchange Service Account\u201d\nEnter the Master Service Account credentials in the pop-up window and save your changes.\n\nNote: These steps must be taken by the Outreach Admin before any additional users are added to Outreach.\nSetting up Outreach User Mailboxes with Master Service Account\nWhen a Master Service Account has been set up, individual users do not need to take any action to set up their mailbox. You can check your mailbox sync by following these steps:\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of Outreach\nOn the top of the settings page, click on \u201cMailboxes\u201d. If your admin has set up the Master Service account, and you\u2019re a brand new Outreach user, your mailbox will already be created and configured to use the service account. When you click into the mailbox, you\u2019ll see the send/sync toggles are enabled. No further actions are necessary! \n\nNote: If your admin has set up the Master Service account after you already had access to Outreach, please email support@outreach.io" .

Simply adding a \"-\" in front of your searches will search for everyone but the group. \nExample\nIt might be useful to search for prospects who are in an active sequence. To do that, use the search  -active_sequence:\"\" \nSegmentation\nSuppose you want to isolate your searches further. You can add in AND or OR to include additional fields. The AND search will include both fields while the OR addition will search for one or the other. \n \nNote: We cannot search fields by \"greater than\" or \"less than\" values, but you can search by ranges. For example, search for number ranges, including in custom fields. If you have a field that uses numbers, like an engagement score or number of people a company, you can search by the range to pull in everyone in that given range. For example, my 'score' field is show size so I want to search everyone with from sizes 1 to 100 'score:[0 TO 100]'\nYou can also search for dates by using [YYYY-MM-DD TO YYYY-MM-DD] for example: \"touched_at:[2017-02-02 TO 2017-02-05]\"\nWildcards \n* - match any characters before or after the insertion of the asterisk. For example, first_name:\"a*\" will pull up any name whose name starts with a.\n? - match a single character. For example, first_name:\"and?\" would pull up any name that is four letters and begins with \"and\"." .

The Outreach Everywhere extension will open. Note: If the prospect does not yet exist in Outreach, you will be presented with an option to import this prospect. Once you proceed, the prospect will be created and the information that your admin has mapped from Salesforce to Outreach will automatically be added to the prospect profile in Outreach.\nUnder the prospect name, click on the button with the paper airplane.\nSelect the sequence you'd like to use by filtering by Collection, using the search, or scrolling through the list of available sequences. You can select \"Show steps\" if you want to preview the steps in the sequence.\nNext, you can decide if you want this prospect sequenced independently (this is the default) or if you'd like to add an additional recipient, for example another prospect or one of your colleagues. If you'd like to add an additional recipient select \"+ Add\". This will group the prospects on the Sequence. Grouped means that all of the prospects will be included on the same email thread (on To or Cc).  The prospect marked as the primary will be added to the \"To\" field. All other prospects will be added to the \"CC\" field.\nIf you'd like to modify any of the email steps within the sequence right now, you can do so by selecting \"Edit Steps\". This allows you to customize both Auto Email and Manual Email steps at once. For Manual Email steps you will still receive a task once that step becomes due, at which point you can include additional customization. If you do not see the Edit Steps option you may have this permission turned off. Check with one of your admins to enable this option. Once you are satisfied with your edits, hit \"Done\".\nIf you would like to specify when the first step of the Sequence starts, simply select the clock icon and choose the date and time you'd like the sequence to begin.\nOnce you have made all of your modifications click \"Add to Sequence\".

Learn more here.\nUsers who already use marketing automation software may need to consult with their marketing team to determine the type of sync needed between the opt out fields.\nThere are 3 common configurations:\n1. Marketing and Outreach share the same Email Opt Out field in Salesforce\nWhen Outreach shares the Email Opt Out field with marketing, both Outreach and the marketing automation software can make the field true, effectively unsubscribing the prospect from any marketing or sales emails in the future. \n2. Create a \"Sales Opt Out\" Field in Salesforce\nThis configuration option is chosen most often as it keeps sales and marketing email opt outs separate, allowing transactional emails between sales and the prospect to take place without affecting marketing.\nTo create this configuration, the user's Salesforce admin must create a writeable true/false checkbox on the contact or lead object called \"Sales Opt Out\" or something similar.\nOnce the field is created in Salesforce, the account admin can work with the Outreach team to map that field in the Salesforce plugin settings within the Outreach platform.\n3. Track Opted Out Prospects in Outreach Only\nIf a user does not wish to sync opted out prospects in Salesforce, the can prevent the creation of or leads and contacts in Outreach or Salesforce by adding conditions to their Salesforce plugin settings on the Lead or Contact Objects.\n\nIf a user does not have a Salesforce integration, they can track prospects who have opted out in Outreach Sequences and Reports sections. Users can then take action on the list as needed depending on the users' preferred workflow.\nNote: If you are using our Communication Preferences (Granular Opt Outs) feature, each opt out type must be synced separately.

On the setting panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cUser Admin\u201d and select \u201cOrg\u201d.\nScroll down the page until you find the section labeled \u201cVidyard Integration\u201d. Click \u201cLearn More\u201d \nYou\u2019ll be redirected to the Vidyard integration installation page.\nClick install, then authorize on the pop-up. \nYou\u2019ve successfully connected your Vidyard account to Outreach! If you are using the free Vidyard plan, please skip to step 8. If you are on the paid Vidyard GoVideo for Teams plan, click the \u201cExternal App Settings\u201d icon to configure the integration. \n\nThere are three parts to the next step explained in detail on Vidyard\u2019s configuration page:\n\n\nAdd your Vidyard API Token - Connect your paid Vidyard account and Outreach\n\n\nEnable Vidyard-branded events in your Outreach Activity Feed - Ensure you\u2019ve filtered in \u201cExternal\u201d activities in your Activity Feed.\n\n\nSetup Outreach Triggers to React to Vidyard Events - After a prospect engages with your Vidyard videos, they will by default remain in the sequence that drove them there. To ensure that prospect\u2019s next step is contextual, you can trigger custom actions within Outreach so they don\u2019t continue in their current sequence unless desired. We recommend setting up a new trigger immediately to designate what should happen next after a Vidyard event occurs.\n\n\n\nSave your changes.\nNow that you\u2019ve enabled the Vidyard integration, Vidyard will begin working automatically. A green check mark verifies that the integration has been successfully installed. \n\nNote: If the integration has already been enabled, you can always come back to this page to manage the Vidyard app\u2019s settings. Instead of seeing the \u201cLearn More\u201d button, you\u2019ll instead see a button that\u2019s labeled \u201cManage App\u201d.\n Using the Vidyard & Outreach Integration\n\nOpen a new email compose window in Outreach, view a prospect\u2019s profile, create new content (sequences, templates, and snippets), or open the task flow. You will now see the Vidyard icon added to the other icons on the bottom of the compose window. \nClick on the vidyard logo on the bottom of the compose window. A pop-up window will appear in Outreach. If it\u2019s your first time using Vidyard, click \u201cSign Up\u201d and authorize the application to work inside Outreach. Otherwise, click \u201cSign In\u201d, enter your Vidyard login credentials, and authorize the integration.\nWhen you're ready to record, click on the Vidyard icon to record your face, your screen, or access videos from your personal & shared Vidyard libraries. Once you\u2019ve selected your video(s), click Insert to add a thumbnail & link of your video to your email.\n\n \nFAQs\nWhat happens if the Vidyard icon isn\u2019t appearing in my Outreach email? \nFirst, has your admin installed the integration in your Org Settings? If the integration is on and the icon still isn\u2019t appearing, contact Outreach Support.\nHow does Vidyard GoVideo pricing work?\n See Vidyard\u2019s pricing here.\nI\u2019m on the free Vidyard plan. Can I still record videos in Outreach?\nYes! Anybody can record and share Vidyard videos in Outreach today for free.  \nWhat do I get if I\u2019m on a paid Vidyard plan? \nContact Vidyard to understand exactly what\u2019s included in your package. In Outreach, you can record and share Vidyard videos for free. Plus, for users on the Vidyard GoVideo for Teams plan, you\u2019ll see Vidyard activity in Outreach which you can use to trigger your next step.\n Why can\u2019t I see Vidyard views and watches in my Outreach activity feed?\nFirst, have you cleared the filters on your activity feed? If \u201cExternal\u201d events are checked/filtered in and you still aren\u2019t seeing your Vidyard activity, contact Outreach Support.\nWhat triggers should I set up?\nEvery situation is different, but we recommend starting with more manual triggers until you know your process. For example, trigger an action item to decide how to follow up after your video is viewed. Or trigger a follow-up sequence with the first step being a manual email, allowing you to decide on personalized messaging.\n \n \n \n \n " .

Create IdP application\n1.1 Create an application inside your IdP and use some \u201cplaceholder\u201d values for the following typical settings:\n\nACS URL / Single sign on URL (e.g. http://outreachfake.com)\nAudience URI / Service Provider Entity ID (e.g. fake_change_later)\n\nIn step 3 below, you will come back to fill in the correct values for the above fields.\n1.2 After creating the application inside your IdP, please take note of its \u201cIssuer,\" \u201cSP-Initiated POST Endpoint\u201d, and the \u201cIdp Certificate\u201d. You will use them in Step 2.3 below.\nStep 2. Create the Identity Provider inside Outreach Accounts\n2.1 As an Outreach admin, you will navigate to the Org\u2019s \u201cSetting\u201d page by going to Settings >> Org, and click the link to \u201cSetup Single Sign On\u201d.\n\n2.2 If it is an org without Idp setup, click \u201cAdd Identity Provider\u201d. \n\n2.3 Add the requested identity provider information\nThe information requested in this section is from step 1.2 above.\n\nNOTE: The above screenshot contains two advanced settings: \"Use NameId Instead of Email\" and \"Enable just-in-time new user provision\". We do NOT recommend checking these options unless the functions of each are understood and needed by your organization. You can read more on these advanced settings in Advanced Settings For Identity Provider (SSO). \n \n2.4 Retrieve setup information from Outreach to put into your IdP provider \nNow find the \u201cSetup Info\u201d section. Copy the  \u201cSetup Info\u201d: \u201cACS URL\u201d and \u201cService Provider Entity ID\u201d information. You will update the IdP application with this information in step 3 below.\n\nNOTE: This screenshot says \u201cOkta\u201d, but the screen will look similar for other other IdP applications. \nStep 3. Update IdP application\nNow go back to your IdP application you created in step 1, and update the application settings:\n\nACS URL / Single sign on URL: use the value for \u201c(ACS) URL\u201d from step 2.3\nAudience URI / Service Provider Entity ID: use the value for \u201cService Provider Entity ID\u201d from step 2.3\n\nStep 4. Enable SSO inside Outreach Accounts\n4.1 Return to your Outreach account and click \u201cTest\u201d to see if the identity provider is set up correctly.\n\nIf successful, you should see a success page. Please examine the \u201cUser email\u201d and make sure it matches with user login email inside Outreach. \n\n4.2 Click \u201cBack\u201d, check \u201cEnable\u201d, and click \u201cSave\u201d.\nNOTE: This screenshot says \u201cOkta\u201d, but the screen will look similar for other other IdP applications.\n\nCongrats!

        _:204659918 <article> "Keeping your CRM free from duplicate records is an industry best practice which prevents incorrect record mappings, mismatching data, accidental record creation, and confusion for your team.\nDeduping in Outreach \nOutreach is designed to allow one prospect record per unique e-mail address. For example, if a user attempts to create new records in Outreach which have duplicate email addresses, one record will import per email address, while the other records with the duplicate email addresses will fail to import.\nRecord Creation from Outreach to Salesforce\nWhen Outreach attempts to create new records in Salesforce through the plugin, Outreach will first look for a corresponding record in Salesforce by using the email address as the key. If a corresponding record is found for the Lead or Contact, Outreach will map to the existing record. Otherwise, the new record will be created. This is another way Outreach prevents your Salesforce instance from duplicate record creation.\nIf both a Lead and Contact are found in Salesforce with the same email address, Outreach will map to whichever object is listed first on the Plugin's \"Types\" page. Looking at the example below, the prospect will be mapped to the Contact object, since the Contact is listed above the Lead.\n\n " .

In step 3, instead of selecting \u201cadd to collection\u201d you\u2019d select \u201cremove from collection\u201d and follow the same steps. The label will be removed from the selected content.\nAssigning Collections of Content to Teams\nOnce you\u2019ve organized your Outreach content into different collections, you can assign collections of content to Outreach teams. This helps your teams easily sort through the Outreach content that is most relevant to their role, and makes finding the right content faster and simpler. \n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left-hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the setting panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cUser Admin\u201d and select \u201cteams.\u201dThere are two ways to assign collections.\nFrom the list view, you can find the team names that should be assigned collections. Click on the checkbox next to the team name and find the folder icon on the top of the page. Click \u201cAdd to collections\u201d and select the appropriate collections from the dropdown menu that appears. Click \u201cAdd\u201d to apply your changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick into the team to see a list of teammates. On the top of the page, click \u201csettings.\u201d Find the collections setting and click into the text box. Select the appropriate collections from the dropdown menu that appears and click \u201cAdd\u201d to save your changes.\n\n\n\nSorting Content by Collection\nOnce a collection is assigned to a team, they can sort content by the collection to find relevant content quickly. You can only see collections for teams you are a part of.\nYou can sort content by collections when adding prospects to a sequence.\nNote: When you search for your content, you\u2019ll always see your favorites at the top of the list. If you have content that you\u2019ve created yourself, these pieces of content will show after your favorites. Below your favorites and content that you own, you\u2019ll see the content included in the team collection.\nYou also have the ability to sort & filter snippet, template, and sequence collections. When you open the sort & filter drawer on any of these three pages, you have a \u201ccollection\u201d menu that segments content contained within the collection selected. Save your frequent searches as a smart view to find the content you need in a few clicks!\n " .

        _:360002711394 <article> "if you notice Outreach activities are not pushing to Salesforce, there are a few steps you can take to ensure the task objects are configured correctly to sync with Salesforce. \nCheck Your API Call Limits\nIf activities are not pushing, the first area of the plugin you\u2019ll want to check is the \u201cLimits\u201d tab. API calls are what push data back and forth between Outreach and Salesforce (see Understanding API Call Usage for further details). If your org has either a) used all allotted API calls for the day or has b) hit the API call threshold in Outreach, we will not be able to push or poll new information to/from Salesforce. As a result no completed activities will be posting back to Salesforce.\nIf you have hit your API limit, you'll need to wait until API call space frees up and then manually push the calls/emails up to Salesforce. The total API call usage is based on a rolling 24 hour limit, so you will be able to retroactively push those activities to Salesforce within a day of hitting your API limits.\nOutreach Admins can check API call limits by doing the following: \n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel, find the section labeled \"System Config\" and select \"Plugins\"\nClick into the Salesforce plugin and on the top of the page select \"Limits\"\nAPI Calls have reached their limits of the color-highlighted number is red and exceeds the overall limit (black)\n\nNote:  When the tasks are retroactively pushed, they will still reflect the time they were completed in Outreach. For example, a call task is completed on February 25th that is  retroactively pushed on March 30th will still have a \u201cDue Date\u201d of February 25th in Salesforce. \nEnsure Completed Activities Satisfy Task Object Conditions\nWithin each advanced task object, you will notice there are some out of the box conditions under \u201cOutbound Create.\u201d Those conditions are there to ensure we are pushing the correct data to Salesforce. For example, the Task <> Call  object has 3 conditions, in particular \u201cProspect Is Not Empty.\u201d You can view conditions under each task mapping settings article. " .

        _:360004405093 <article> "Outreach Opportunities allows users to manage and track opportunities through the entire sales pipeline, enabling them to engage in more meaningful ways and measure revenue attribution down to the activity. With the Salesforce plugin, you have the option to bring Salesforce Opportunities into Outreach automatically.\nWe recommend keeping outbound create and update off. Opportunities have many validation rules that must be met to create new Opportunities or update existing Opportunities. Because there is no visibility into validation rules from within Outreach, the creation and updating of Opportunities should remain in Salesforce.\nIf you have Advanced Task Mappings enabled on your account, please review the Salesforce setup steps found in this article.\nAdjusting the Salesforce Plugin for Outreach Opportunities\nTo sync Opportunities into Outreach, the Salesforce plugin needs to be set up correctly. You must be an Outreach Admin to make any adjustments to the plugin.\n\nClick on the initials in the bottom left hand corner of Outreach, and click \"plugins\" under the settings panel.\n\n\n\n\nClick into the Salesforce plugin. You\u2019ll see three new plugin types: \u201cOpportunity\u201d, \u201cOpportunity Stages\u201d and \u201cOpportunity Contact Role\u201d.  We\u2019ll go over each in detail below.\n\nOpportunity\n\n\nClick into the Opportunity type. \nWe recommend enabling the following toggles:\n\nPolling\n\nPeriodically poll Salesforce for new and changed Opportunities   Looks up to Salesforce to see if there have been any changes in the Salesforce Opportunity that are not yet reflected in Outreach. This must be enabled for any \u201cInbound Create\u201d or \u201cInbound Update\u201d toggles to trigger.\n\n\nInbound Create\n\nInbound create new Opportunities - Looks up to Salesforce to see if there are any new Opportunities in Salesforce that should be added to Outreach. If so, Outreach will pull them into the platform.\nInbound create associated contacts - When enabled, every time an Opportunity is created in Outreach, the plugin will also create any contacts associated to the Opportunity.\nSync data down after manual create inside Outreach - When enabled, every time Opportunities are manually created in Outreach, the plugin will search for the associated Opportunity in Salesforce and pull in relevant data.\n\n\nInbound Update\n\nUpdate existing Opportunities - When enabled, the plugin will look up to Salesforce to see if existing Opportunities have any updates that do not yet reflect in Outreach. If so, the plugin will update the Opportunities with the most up-to-date information.\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend keeping outbound create and update off. Opportunities have many validation rules that must be met to create new Opportunities or update existing Opportunities. Because there is no visibility into validation rules from within Outreach, the creation and updating of Opportunities should remain in Salesforce. To prevent users from editing Opportunities in Outreach, we also recommend disabling edits through governance profiles.\nOn the top of the page, click on \u201cFields\u201d. These are the fields that Outreach is syncing from Salesforce. \nField settings come out of the box, but can be adjusted as needed.\n\n\n\n\nYou can add additional fields by clicking the \u201cadd\u201d button on the top right hand side of the page. To remove an existing mapping, click on the dropdown arrow that appears to the right when hovering over the field that needs to be removed.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the checkboxes on the right side of the page are enabled to \u201cupdate in\u201d.\nRegardless of how you adjust these settings, we recommend adding Opportunity Type, External Created Date, and Prospecting Rep ID. This helps Outreach with Opportunity Attribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOpportunity Contact Roles\n\n\nClick into the Opportunity Contact Roles type.\nWe recommend enabling the following toggles:\n\nPolling\n\nPeriodically poll Salesforce for new and changed Opportunity contact roles - When enabled, the Outreach plugin will look up to Salesforce to see if there have been any changes in the Salesforce Opportunity contact roles that are not yet reflected in Outreach. This must be enabled for any \"Inbound Create\" or \"Inbound Update\" toggles to trigger.\n\n\nPushing\n\nAutomatically push changes to Salesforce - When enabled, the Outreach plugin will compare the contact role in Outreach to the contact role in Salesforce. If they don't match, and the contact role was updated more recently in Outreach, the plugin will update the contact role in Salesforce.\n\n\nInbound Create\n\nCreate new Opportunity prospect roles - When enabled, the plugin will look up to Salesforce to see if there are any new Opportunity contact roles in Salesforce that should be added in Outreach. If so, Outreach will pull them into the platform.\nSync data down after manual create inside Outreach - When enabled, every time Opportunity contact roles are manually created in Outreach, the plugin will search for the associated Opportunity in Salesforce and pull in relevant data.\n\n\nInbound Update\n\nUpdate existing Opportunities - When enabled, the plugin will look up to Salesforce to see if existing Opportunity contact roles in Salesforce have updates that are not yet reflected in Outreach. If so, the plugin will update the Outreach prospect with the updated Opportunity contact role.\n\n\nOutbound Create\n\nCreate new Opportunity contact roles - When enabled, Outreach will create the new Contact Role type in Salesforce, if it doesn't exist already.\n\n\nOutbound Update\n\nUpdate Existing Opportunity Contact Roles - Outreach will associate the Contact and the assigned Contact Role to the Opportunity in Salesforce if not already present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the top of the page, click on \u201cFields\u201d. These are the fields that Outreach is syncing from Salesforce. \nField settings come out of the box, but can be adjusted as needed. Regardless of how you adjust these settings, we recommend keeping Opportunity, Prospect, Role, and Primary. \nMake sure that the checkboxes on the right side of the page are enabled to \u201cupdate in\u201d. We also recommend checking the \u201cupdate out\u201d checkbox for \u201cRole\u201d and \u201cPrimary\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've set up your Contact Roles in the Salesforce plugin, make sure you create a new Outreach picklist so your Outreach users can easily select the appropriate Contact Role from a dropdown menu. \nOpportunity Stage\nPlease reference support documentation on creating Opportunity Stages in Outreach before moving forward with the steps outlined below.\n\nClick into the Opportunity Stage type in the Outreach plugin.\nOn the top of the page, click on \u201cFields\u201d. These are the fields that Outreach is syncing from Salesforce.\n\n\n\n\nField settings come out of the box, but can be adjusted as needed.Regardless of how you adjust these settings, we recommend adding Name, Order, Active, Is Closed, and Is Won for opportunity association and revenue attribution.\nMake sure that the checkboxes on the right side of the page are enabled to \u201cupdate in\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \u201cMappings\u201d section on the top of the page. Map your existing Outreach Opportunity Stages to the associated Salesforce Opportunity Stages.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalendar Event\nIf you'd like to sync meetings held to an Opportunity, you'll need to add an additional field to the Calendar Event plugin type.\n\nClick into theEvent type in the Outreach plugin.\nOn the top of the page, click on \u201cFields\u201d. These are the fields that Outreach is syncing to and from Salesforce.\nClick on the \"Add\" button on the top right hand corner of the page.\n\n\n\n\nScroll to the bottom of the added fields and map \"Opportunity\" to \"Related to ID\"\nMake sure that the checkboxes on the right side of the page are enabled to \u201cupdate in\u201d and \"update out\".\n\n\n\n\nHover to the right of the newly mapped field until you see a dropdown arrow. Click on the dropdown arrow and select \"Advanced\".\nIn the pop out window that appears, check the box that asks if this is a mapped field. Below the checkbox, click on the dropdown labeled \"External Mapped Type\" and select \"Opportunity\".\n\n\n\n\nSave your changes.\n\nDisable Fallback Sync Option on Plugin Types\nNow that you have Opportunities set up with your Salesforce plugin, you'll need to disable Outreach's fallback sync option. This will ensure duplicate tasks are not synced into Salesforce. For this example, we'll ask you to disable the toggle on the contact, but these steps should be repeated on the event object.\n\nIn the Salesforce plugin, make sure you've selected \"Types\" on the top of the page.\nThe fallback sync option can be found on the contact and event objects. \nClick into the contact object. On the landing page find the section labeled \"Messages & Events\".\n\n\n\n\nDisable the toggle that is labeled \"Fallback to associate activity with most recent Opportunity in Salesforce\".\n\n\n\n\nRepeat steps 1-4 on the event object. \n\n " .

Create the Identity Provider inside Outreach\n2.1 As an Outreach admin, you will navigate to the Org\u2019s \u201cSetting\u201d page by going to Settings >> Org, and click the link to \u201cSign On Options\u201d\n\n2.2 If it is an org without SSO already setup, click \u201cAdd Identity Provider\u201d\n\n2.3 Add the requested identity provider information. The information requested in this section is from step 1.3 above.\nNOTE: The above screenshot contains two advanced settings: \"Use NameId Instead of Email\" and \"Enable just-in-time new user provision\". We do NOT recommend checking these options unless the functions of each are understood and needed by your organization. You can read more on these advanced settings in Advanced Settings For Identity Provider (SSO). \n2.4 Retrieve setup information from Outreach to put into Onelogin\n\nNOTE: This screenshot says \u201cOkta\u201d, but the screen will look similar for OneLogin.\nNow find the \u201cSetup Info\u201d section. Copy the \u201cACS URL\u201d and \u201cService Provider Entity ID\u201d, we will update the Onelogin application with this information in step 3 below.\n\nNOTE: This screenshot says \u201cOkta\u201d, but the screen will look similar for OneLogin.\nStep 3. Update OneLogin application\nReturn to the OneLogin application you created in step 1, click on the \u201cConfiguration\u201d tab, and update the following application settings:\n\nAudience: use the value for \u201cService Provider Entity ID\u201d from step 2.3\nRecipient: use the value for \u201c(ACS) URL\u201d from step 2.3\nACS (Consumer) URL Validator: https:\\/\\/outreach-prod.auth0.com\\/\nACS (Consumer) URL: use the value for \u201c(ACS) URL\u201d from step 2.3\n\n\nStep 4.

        _:221240968 <article> "If you have a marketing department, they are probably generating leads for inbound sales people. One of the most important questions a company can ask themselves about their inbound process is \"How personalized do we want to get?\" With an intelligent combination of triggers and sequences, you can create a fully-automated inbound process with room for heavy personalization.\nBest Practices\nMap Lead and/or Contact fields from Salesforce to the Prospect fields in Outreach\n\nIt is extremely important that Outreach capture the same insights that marketing is able to when generating inbound leads. This is typically done by creating a field for each thing you care about on the Lead object in Salesforce, then mapping that to Outreach so we can mirror that data and use it to generate hyper-personalized content.\nIf you don't use Salesforce, you can simulate this approach by exporting your inbound leads from your existing CRM and importing them in bulk into Outreach.\n\nBuild a trigger\n\nWhen leads are generated through marketing funnels and eventually land in your CRM, they often need to meet certain criteria to qualify as a marketing-generated lead. At this point, Outreach can take over with the use of the Trigger feature. If your CRM is Salesforce, the trigger can look at fields on the Lead's page layout then take action based on those field values (e.g. automatically add to \"White Paper Download\" sequence if Lead Score is \"12\" and Source is \"white paper\").\nIf you don't use Salesforce, you can create the same automated process by first creating the trigger in Outreach, then exporting your inbound leads from your existing CRM and importing them in bulk into Outreach.\nAutomatically sequence your inbound leads from Salesforce\n\nAutomated emails vs. heavily personalized touch-points\n\nDepending on the level of personalization you want, you may choose to build fully automated email sequences, task-based sequences or both. However you slice and dice your inbound leads, you can always address each customer segment with its own set of customized triggers and sequences. For inbound leads that are considered 'high value', we recommend building sequences into a cadence of manual tasks that gives the sales person the freedom to personalize each touch-point on their own.\n\nOptional: Auto-convert inbound Leads to Contacts in Salesforce\n\nSome customers qualify a lead before it gets into the hands of the sellers. If that's the case, you may want to consider setting up a workflow rule in Salesforce that automatically matches inbound leads to existing Accounts by the lead's email domain, then automatically converting it to a Contact before distributing it to the sales team.\n" .

        _:115002471533 <article> "The sales navigator lead tile pulls information from the profile of the specific lead you\u2019re looking at. The lead tile includes basic information from LinkedIn about the prospect including their current position, time in current role, and current location. This is a great way to verify location or verify that nothing major has changed since you last engaged before you reach out.  \nBy simply using the lead tile and loading the prospect overview, your prospect will see you\u2019ve viewed their profile. When you enhance a call or manual email with an automatic profile view, you get two sales touch points for the price of one.\nUnderstanding the LinkedIn Sales Navigator Tiles\nSales Navigator Lead Tile Information\n1. Icebreakers\n This highlights what LinkedIn determines to be the most important information on the lead.  This includes mutual connections and recent activity like shared posts or published articles. You can use these updates to see how active your prospect is on LInkedIn and know when it's a good time to reach out.\n\n2. Get Introduced\nThis tab shows 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level connections in your network that are also connected to this lead. This empowers you to find a common connection or reach out to a colleague to get an introduction.\n\n3. Related Leads\nFind individuals similar to the lead you're looking at based on your Sales Navigator preferences. This can be used to expand your potential pool or prospects.\n\nSales Navigator Account Tile\nThe account tile pulls information from the company page on LinkedIn. This includes industry, number of employees, and the location of the headquarters. Within the Account tile you can see three tabs:\n1. Recommend LeadsThis information helps you find new leads from the company you're targeting, which can be added to Outreach straight from the tile. The recommended leads highlight who may be the best lead based on your Sales Navigator preferences.\n\n2. Connections\nShows you connections that work at the company, to help you get a foot in the door. It's a great start for any kind of strategic engagement, working multiple prospects in an account.\n\n3. News\nRecent posts from both the company and employees so you can plan more personalized outreach to your prospect. These items are clickable, linking you directly to the actual articles so you can learn more.\n\n " .

        _:360002325673 <article> "Every organization is unique in the way they manage data and processes in Salesforce. Some workflows may result in multiple leads or contacts with the same email address. Though unintuitive, dupes can be intentional. For example, some leads/contacts need to be worked by different reps, there may be multiple product lines, or you may have separate sales and marketing leads/contacts. Regardless, you need to have the flexibility follow your unique workflow in the platform where you take action: Outreach.  \nWith Outreach, if a prospect with the same email address already exists in the platform, we give you the option to remap the Outreach prospect to the appropriate Salesforce record.\nProspect Settings to Allow Remapping\nBecause everyone works with duplicate leads and contacts differently, Outreach will not automatically enable the option to remap to the Outreach prospect to the appropriate Salesforce record. To enable remapping, follow the steps outlined below.\n\nClick on the initials on the bottom left hand corner of the Outreach platform.\nOn the settings panel that appears, find the section labeled \u201cSystem Config\u201d and select \u201cProspects\u201d.\nFind the \u201cBasic Info\u201d Section.

Regardless of whether or not you use Outreach Voice, all logged calls will be included in these metrics and can give you insight into what's working and where you can make adjustments.\nBelow we go over the call analytics charts, so you can better understand the information that's being surfaced by Outreach.\nCall Analytics\nAnswered & Unanswered Calls by Call Disposition \n These charts break down the call activity further by showing the disposition associated with calls that were answered vs. unanswered. These graphs can be viewed by day, week, or month.\n\nBest Time to Call by Connection Rate \nThis chart is a heat map, where the darker purple indicates a higher connection rate. The top of the chart lists the hour each day of the week that experience the most call connections. The bottom 1% of data is not included in the best time to call suggestions because there is not enough activity to make the suggestion. Time zone is taken into consideration. If someone on the East Coast calls a prospect at 9am and connected, for example, if the user is located in Seattle we would surface the call at 6am as a suggested time to call.\n\nCall Activity by Call Disposition \nThe graph shows the total number of calls placed by Outreach users, and breaks down these calls by whether they were inbound or outbound, as well as the associated call disposition selected when the call was logged. The chart can be viewed by day, week, or month.\n\nCall Activity \nThe calling activity shows the number of calls and duration of time spent dialing by team, user, or role during the specified time period. Data also includes the average duration of connected calls. The overview stats call out the total average talk time and bucket the call lengths for every call (0-5 minutes, 5-15 minutes, 15-30 minutes, and over 30 minutes)\n\nCalls Made vs. Quality Calls \n This chart represents the number of calls made over a period of time vs those that were meaningful conversations. Quality calls are defined as calls that connected which lasted more than 30 seconds.\n\nOutbound Call Activity by Time of Day \nThis chart is a heat map, where the darker purple indicates a higher number of calls by owners. The top of the chart lists the hour each day when most calls are placed.\n\nCall by Connection Time\nYou can filter calls by: under 30 seconds; 30 seconds - 2 minutes; 2-5 minutes; 5-10 minutes; and over 10 minutes. Since longer calls indicate your team is having meaningful conversations and connecting with prospects, it\u2019s key that you\u2019re able to differentiate between your four minute calls and your 15 minute calls at a glance. You can see this in aggregate or by individual user.

There is currently a setting for an org to choose its \"home\" timezone.\nCharacters and encoding - All written characters are fully supported in templates, snippets, and sequences.  Outreach Templates and mailings support both English language characters and Japanese Kanji.\nInterface language - The Outreach platform interface is in English only.  No plans currently exist to translate the platform into any other language.\nOOO detection - Outreach detects OOO (Out Of Office) messages based on phrases appearing in either the subject or body of the message.  Most of the phrases we search for are in English, but we do search for 2 phrases in German and one in French.  \nAccess - This one is fairly specific to China due to the national firewall that restricts access to some sites.  As of our last check, our app is accessible from inside the firewall.  You can check for this here.  \nCurrency - At this time, Opportunities in Outreach only support U.S. Currency in the form of the $ symbol.\nOther cultural, regional, or language considerations - Most of these should be handled by the web browser and no special accommodation has been made by Outreach to detect the user's native language, culture, or region and make changes based on that information.  Any specific requests as it pertains to a language, culture, or region can be requested by submitting a request to our support team using the Support portal. \n" .

        _:220339488 <article> "DISCLAIMER: the information provided below is for informational purposes only. Please consult your legal counsel if you have specific questions on compliance with any relevant laws.  \n \nUnited States Call Recording: One-party vs. Two-party Consent\nWhen it comes to the legality of call recording in the United States, states typically adopt a one-party consent policy or a two-party consent policy. A one-party consent policy states that you'll you need consent from one of the parties participating in a call in order to record. Some states, however, have opted for a two-party consent policy (often known as all-party consent) where all parties have to be informed that the call is being recorded. Whether a state is one-party or two-party it is best practice to obtain consent from all parties in the call.\nNote: The consent requirement is based on the physical location of the prospect. It is not solely tied to the area code that their phone number is registered in. \n \nOne-Party Consent States:\n\nAlabama\nAlaska\nArizona\nArkansas\nColorado\nDistrict of Columbia\nGeorgia\nHawaii\nIdaho\nIndiana\nIowa\nKansas\nKentucky\nLouisiana\nMaine\nMinnesota\nMississippi\nMissouri\nNebraska\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico\nNew York\nNorth Carolina\nNorth Dakota\nOhio\nOklahoma\nRhode Island\nSouth Carolina\nSouth Dakota\nTennessee\nTexas\nUtah\nVirginia\nWest Virginia\nWisconsin\nWyoming\n\nTwo-Party Consent States:\n\nCalifornia\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nFlorida\nIllinois\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMontana\nNevada\nNew Hampshire\nOregon\nPennsylvania\nVermont\nWashington\n\n *Outreach will require users to manually confirm consent when initiating any recorded call if the \"Show Two Party Consent Dialog\" feature is enabled. \n \nInternational Call Recording\nInternational call recording regulations vary widely, and the local government\u2019s telecommunications authority should be consulted prior to initiating a call recording system. Many countries do not have specific laws covering telecommunication issues, and thus operate on a case-by-case basis. When in doubt it is best practice to obtain consent from all parties in the call.\n \nAustralia\nIf a call is to be recorded or monitored, you must inform parties at the beginning of the conversation so that the respective parties have the chance to either end the call, or to ask to be transferred to another line where monitoring or recording does not take place (if this is available).\n In the state of Queensland, however, it is not illegal to simply record a telephone conversation if you are a party to the conversation.\n \nCanada\nCanada has an \"all-parties' consent\" approach: to record a call, you need to obtain informed consent by notifying others on the call.\n(1) That you intend to record the conversation.\n(2) Any purposes the recording will be used for.\n(3) That the call may only be recorded with each person's consent.\n For more details on Canada's approach, you can take a look at the Privacy Commissioner's Guidelines for Recording Customer Calls.\n \nGermany\nGermany is a two party consent country, meaning telephone recording without the consent of the two or, when applicable, more, parties is a criminal offense. In addition, Germany requires that VOIP users have a German address to use a German number.\n \nIreland\nIrish law states that the purpose of the recording should be explained in detail, so the parties participating can give informed consent. \n \nUK\nCall recording in the UK is subject to several laws. It\u2019s best to think of the UK as a Two Party Consent jurisdiction.\n \nMaldives\nWe currently do not support calls to/from the Maldives. Please submit a request to support through the support portal if you need more information.\nOther Countries...\nWhile we've listed certain countries above, it is by no means a complete list. Before making a call to a new country, we recommend making sure that you and your legal team have an understanding of any regulations there.\n " .

Intervals will then correspond with the schedule, looking at schedule time blocks, to decide whether it should or should not initiate that step.\n\nIf a step lands outside of an available time block, Outreach will wait until the next available window to initiate that step. As that step moves forward, the rest of the schedule will move forward so the following steps do not play 'catch up'.\n\nAn example of this in action would look like:\n\nStep 1 email goes out on day 1.\nStep 2 email is scheduled to be delivered 3 days later.\n3 days later, step 2 lands on a Sunday.\nSince there are no available time blocks on Sunday, per the schedule owner's customization, step 2 will not send until the next available time block.\nThe next available time block is Monday from 9am-4pm, so it waits until 9am on Monday to send step 2. \nStep 3, which was scheduled for 3 days after step 2, will now send 3 days after Monday instead of 3 days after Sunday\n" .

        _:360036958074 <article> "Often reps will be sequencing multiple prospects from the same account in order to get in touch with someone. When one of those prospects ends up setting a meeting with one of your users, you may want to stop sequences that are running for any other prospects in that account. Configuring triggers for this will remove the need for manually finding those prospects and finishing their sequences, preventing any unnecessary steps from being sent to them.\nThis process require two triggers: one to update a custom field on the account when a meeting is booked and one to stop all sequences for prospects in that account. \nBefore building these triggers, a custom field on the account will need to be designated for this use. Label this field \"Meeting Booked.\"\nTrigger to Update Account When Meeting is Booked\nFirst, let's build the trigger to update the account. This will make use of the \"Meeting Booked\" custom field you created. \nNavigate to Settings > Triggers in the Outreach menu and click the \"+ Add\" button in the top right to create a new trigger. \nNaming Your Triggers\nAs a best practice, label each of your triggers descriptively with a summary of its event and action. For Account triggers, we recommend adding a consistent label to the beginning such as [Account Trigger] and number your paired triggers, such as \"Meeting Booked 1\" and \"Meeting Booked 2.\" \nFor example, the first in this pair of your triggers could be named \"[Account Trigger] - Meeting Booked 1 - Update Account When Demo Meeting Booked.\"  \nFollowing this convention will help you easily spot the triggers you need, especially as your list of triggers grows. \nTrigger Event\nThis prompts the trigger to begin checking the trigger conditions whenever the event takes place.\nThe event for this trigger should be \"Meeting Booked\" so the trigger attempts to take action once a meeting is booked with a prospect.\n\nTrigger Target\nThe target tells the trigger which object it will be adjusting. In this case, we want to set the target to Account so we can update a field on the account. \n\nTrigger Conditions\nTrigger conditions can be set to restrict the trigger to only specific prospects, meetings, or accounts. For example, if we want this trigger to fire only when the meeting that was booked was a Contextual Demo meeting, we could use the following condition: \n\nTrigger Actions\nThe trigger action takes place once the event and conditions are met. For this trigger, we'll set the \"Meeting Booked\" field on the Account to \"true.\" Once this action is added, click \"Save\" in the top-right corner. \n\nCompleted Trigger 1\nPutting it all together, your completed trigger will look similar to this: \n\nTrigger to Stop All Sequences\nThe second trigger we will build will stop any active sequences for all prospects in the account. Again we recommend labeling your trigger descriptively to make it easy to identify later. \nFor example, let's name this trigger \"[Account Trigger] - Meeting Booked 2 - Stop All Sequences for Account if Meeting Booked.\"\nNote: Triggers fire in the order they are listed, so this trigger must come after the first trigger in your full list of triggers. \nTrigger Event\nFor this trigger, the event will be \"Account Updated.\" \n\nTrigger Target\nThe target here will be set to \"All Prospects (For Account)\" so we can mark their sequences as finished. You also have the option to limit this trigger to only firing once per target. This setting allows the trigger to only update each prospect one time when the conditions are met. \n\nTrigger Conditions\nAccount conditions can be used to specify which Accounts are affected by this trigger. We will add a condition to check for \"true\" in the \"Meeting Booked\" field, which is set by the first trigger created above. \n\nTrigger Actions\nSet the action to \"Stop Sequences.\"\n\nRemember to save your trigger. \nCompleted Trigger 2\nPutting it all together, your completed trigger will look similar to this: \n \nOnce both are ready for use, you will need to go to your list of triggers and enable your two new triggers with the toggle to the left of their names!" .

Steps are separated by time intervals, which can range from immediately months in the future. The steps will action (email delivery, task creation, etc.) based on your browser timezone, not on the prospect's timezone or schedule.\nFor example, to send a Quarterly email; a step would be delivered every 90 days:\n\nWith time interval steps, prospects can be added to sequences at any time. When added, the prospect will follow the specified time intervals. In the previous example, the first email would be delivered 90 days after the prospect was added to the sequence.\nNote: If an email does not send due to a sending limit being reached by the email provider, sequences will automatically retry to send after 24 hours or will send when the sending limit has been reset, see Email Limits & Safeguards.\nSteps By Exact Date/Time\nThis sequence type is used when a one time event is being scheduled, such as a webinar, conference, or trade show. For example, to send an email notifying prospects of an upcoming event; a step would look like:\n\nOnce a date and time have been chosen by a user, no additional prospects can be added to the sequence if the specified date has passed.\n \n \n \n " .

        _:360001590314 <header> "Understanding Why Prospects Pend" .
        _:360001590314 <article> "When prospects are added to a sequence, they may show as pending, rather than active. This is usually due to your sequence settings. The settings that may cause a prospect to pend include: the sequence throttle, the sequence schedule, a step-specific schedule, or a combination of these settings. Otherwise, it's possible your sequence hasn't been enabled. Below we'll cover how these settings affect prospects in a sequence.\nSequence Throttle \nWhen prospects are added to the sequence, the sequence looks at the settings page to see if there is a throttle enabled. The throttle looks at the number of prospects being added to the sequence every 24 hours. The throttle will only activate prospects if the limitation has not already been met. If the throttle number has been met, any additional prospects will be placed in a pending state. 24 hours later, the throttle resets and allows more prospects to activate in the sequence and are added to the first step.\nYou can learn more about how sequence throttles work here. If you want to bypass the throttle and activate your prospects in the sequence, follow the steps outlined in this article.\nSequence Schedule\nIn addition to the sequence throttle, prospects added to a sequence follow an outlined sequence schedule. If prospects are added to the sequence outside of a pre-determined time block, the prospects will remain in a pending state until an available time block is open for delivery. Once the sequence schedule opens, the prospects are automatically activated in the sequence.\nThe sequence schedule will still defer to the sequence throttle. Let's say for example that I have a throttle that limits me to activating 50 prospects per day, but I add 150 prospects to the sequence outside of my sequence schedule. The prospects will stay in a pending state until my sequence schedule has an open time block. However, because I have a throttle, only 50 of my 150 prospects will activate in the sequence.\nYou can learn more about how sequence schedules work here. If you want to bypass the throttle and/or sequence schedule and activate your prospects in the sequence, follow the steps outlined in this article.\nStep-Specific Schedule\nIf you find that the sequence throttle has not been met and there is an available time block on your sequence schedule, your prospects may be following a step-specific schedule. Step-specific schedules are created and applied to a single step in the sequence and override the sequence schedule. You can view a step-specific schedule by following these steps. If the step is not using a step-specific schedule, the setting will say \"use sequence schedule\".\nAs with the sequence schedule, step-specific schedules will not activate prospects until there is an available time block. If you want to bypass the step-specific schedule and activate your prospects in the sequence, follow the steps outlined in this article.\nEnable the Sequence Using the Master Sequence Toggle\nIf you've checked all of the above, it's likely that your sequence hasn't been properly enabled. Find your sequence on the sequence overview page and click on the toggle next to the name of the sequence. If you click into a specific sequence, the master toggle is found on the top left hand side of the page." .

        _:219998808 <article> "Purpose: \nThe purpose of this article is to provide information to Outreach users regarding Outreach's Local Dial feature. \nLocal Dial allows Outreach users to choose the area code to display when calling a Prospect. The Local Dial feature allows Outreach users to call from a number that matches the area code of the end recipient, increasing the likelihood the Prospect will answer the call.\nEnabling the Local Dial feature in Outreach Voice ensures the number you are dialing from matches the region of the end recipient. Once used, the assigned phone number is added to your organization and kept in a bank with numbers from different regions for future use. If Local Dial is enabled and you have a privately reserved number attached to your Outreach profile that matches the end recipient's area code, Outreach takes the matching number in your private phone number list to use for calls, even if there isn't an area code in your organization's bank.\nFor example, if users call a New York-based Prospect, Outreach automatically selects a New York City area code, 212. If the user already has a New York phone number, Outreach defaults to the user\u2019s number.\nThere are a limited number of area codes available in a region. If a local area code is unavailable, and the user number is from outside of the area, Outreach assigns a phone number with the next closest area code in the region. For example, if 212 is not available for New York City, Outreach assigns a 646 number.\nThe Outreach dialer is smart enough to match inbound phone numbers and the local dialer number, so when the Prospect calls back, Outreach routes the call to the Outreach user that most recently dialed the Prospect. If the inbound call does not have an associated Outreach user, the call will be routed to the last person who used the local number. If the local number has never been used by Outreach (ex: the local number was recently purchased but never used), Outreach routes the call to the most recent active Outreach user.\n " .

The different variable types are outlined below, and you can find a comprehensive list of all available variables here.\n Prospect Variables\nAll prospect fields, including custom fields, can be auto-populated. \nAccount Variables\nVariables can also be pulled from the account if the information is available on the account profile in Outreach. The account variable options are found under the account option in the variable menu.\nSender Variables\nSender variables allow all Outreach users to use templates without the concern of attaching one user's information to another user's prospect. The most common example is the {{sender.first_name}}, which inserts the name of the user whose mailbox is used to send the email.\nThe fillable fields for the sender variables are found under each individual Outreach user's settings.\n Miscellaneous Variables\nMiscellaneous variables include conditional variables, comments, and day of the week variables.\nConditional Variables\nConditional variables say \"if the condition is true, then use specified language\".\nThese variables are powerful to use when you want conditional language where you can specify a word or phrase to be used if a certain statement is true (ie if no first name, then say_____). Conditional variables are formatted like this: \nHi {{#if first_name}}{{first_name}} {{else}} there {{/if}} - If prospect has a first name, \"Hi first name\". Otherwise \"Hi there\".\nThe conditional prospect variables can be found in the miscellaneous tab of the variable menu.\nComments\nComments can be used in manual email steps to help you remember to make note of something. You will see this note and be reminded to insert appropriate text. For example, research you've done on the prospect that is relevant to the prospect you're attempting to contact.  Variables that require manual action before delivery will be highlighted blue, and have an exclamation point inside of the double brackets. Variables formatted with the exclamation point tell Outreach that the email cannot be delivered until the required information is added. \n\nHelpers\nThe {{format_number}} variable can be used with number fields such as score to display the value in that field in an easy to ready format. For example, using {{format_number score}} with a prospect whose score field is \"1.0\" will display \"1\" in your template instead. \nDates\nVariables based on the \"day of the week\" are a powerful way to personalize your emails and increase the reply rate from prospects by customizing language based on the day of the week. These variables can be found when creating email templates in the variable menu under miscellaneous. You can learn more here.\nVariables as Links\n You can add variables to URLs for advanced and customized click tracking. \n**You can find a list of all available variables here.\n " .

        _:217530828 <article> "Purpose: \nThe purpose of this article is to provide information to Outreach users regarding the pros and cons of computer-dialing and phone-dialing.  \nOutreach Voice provides the option of  starting a voice call with any domestic or international phone number using either your computer or a phone. \nComputer-Dialing\nComputer-dialing is the process of utilizing your internet connection to make a call. If you have ever used Skype, you have used a computer-dialing solution. When you use a computer, you are calling via the internet, allowing you to plug your headphones directly into your computer.\nPros:\n\nUsing your computer for calling is more economical than calling via phone because you get to reduce your leverage of traditional telco lines. For more information on pricing, refer to the Outreach Voice Pricing article. \nUsers can plug their headphones or headset directly into the computer if they wish to make a call.\nUsers can leverage Voice when they have an internet connection, but don't have a landline, or very strong cell signal.\n\nCons:\n\nCalling using a computer does require a good internet connection for good call quality. This includes both your connection speed and connection quality. For this reason, Outreach recommends using a wired network connection. For more information on configuration requirements for optimal call quality, refer to the Network Requirements for IT Admins & Network Engineers article. \nOptimal call quality requires specific network configurations. \nFor more information on configuration requirements for optimal call quality, refer to the Network Requirements for IT Admins & Network Engineers article. \n\nFor more information on computer-based calling workflows, refer to the Initiating Calls in Outreach article. \nPhone Dialing\nDialing by a phone functions by dialing the outbound number through the Outreach Voice system (from your Outreach Voice number) and dialing your landline or mobile number, in order to establish a connection through the standard telco lines. While this method is very high in audio quality, it is less economical than a computer-based dialing method.\nPros:\n\nThe call quality is what you would expect from a mobile phone or landline because this method leverages traditional telco \"hard lines\" and cell towers, like what you see strung across telephone poles.\nUsers can use their headphones or headset that connects to their landline or mobile phone.\n\nCons:\n\nThe increased footprint on traditional telco channels incurs more cost because they need their slice of the pie when their services are leveraged. For more information on pricing, see our Voice pricing information.\nPhone dialing does take longer to connect than a computer-based call because there is an additional connection to be made to start; however, once a call is initiated, a user could make multiple calls via the user interface, while keeping the line open.\nUsing Outreach phone on top of an existing computer-based method is not recommended as this adds additional delay in the call and there may be some feature incompatibility between both systems. \n\nFor more information regarding phone-based calling workflows, refer to the Initiating Calls in Outreach article.

These activities may include steps like:\n\nSending a connection request\nViewing a profile\nInteracting with posted content (liking, commenting, or sharing)\nSending a message through InMail\n\nOutreach simplifies these tasks by introducing LinkedIn-specific tasks as sequence steps.\nNote: Make sure you update your Salesforce plugin so LinkedIn tasks sync to Salesforce.\nCreating a LinkedIn Sequence Step\n\n\nCreate a new sequence or add a new step to an existing sequence\nOn the top right corner, click \u201cAdd Step\u201d\nClick on the \u201cStep Type\u201d dropdown menu. You\u2019ll see now LinkedIn options, which we\u2019ll go into further detail later in this article:\n\nLinkedIn: View a Profile - Creates a task to view a prospect\u2019s LinkedIn profile\nLinkedIn: Interact with Post - Creates a task to interact with a prospect\u2019s post\nLinkedIn: Send Message - Creates a task to send a message through LinkedIn. You can include a template to copy/paste into the LinkedIn message.\nLinkedIn: Send Connection Request - Creates a task to send a connection request to the prospect\nLinkedIn: Other - Task to do other LinkedIn work - Similar to a generic task,  let\u2019s you specify another action in LinkedIn\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the sequence step is identified as a LinkedIn step\n\n\nCompleting LinkedIn Tasks\nThe LinkedIn task types will appear on the task list on the 360 page, and will also be sorted into the Sequence bucket of the global sidebar.\n\nThe following instructions explain how to perform LinkedIn Tasks using the integration with LinkedIn Sales Navigator (requires a Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise license). See here for instructions on performing LinkedIn tasks without a Sales Navigator license.\nEnabling the LinkedIn Sales Navigator Tasks\nThe LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration is defaulted to \u201con\u201d for all Outreach accounts. You can toggle the Sales Navigator integration on and off by following these steps. (Use of the LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration requires a Sales Navigator Team or Enterprise license.)\n\nClick into the task flow view by selecting a task from the 360 view or task overview page.\nClick on the three dots found on the top right hand side of the task execution view\nEnable the toggle as needed. When the toggle is enabled, you\u2019ll see a Sales Navigator tile with additional information. \n\nLinkedIn: View a Profile\nWhen you click into the LinkedIn Sales Navigator task, you\u2019ll see a LinkedIn compose window where you can write a personal note to add to your invitation. If the sequence task includes a template, you can click on the button next to the template text to copy the message that needs to be sent to the prospect. Variables included in the template will automatically fill out with the prospect\u2019s information. Paste the text into the compose window and click on the \u201csend invite\u201d button. Your message and invitation will be sent to the prospect\u2019s InMail, as long as you have not met your InMail monthly cap.\n\nLinkedIn: Interact with a Post\nWhen you click into the LinkedIn task, you\u2019ll see a button on the task flow that says \u201cInteract.\u201d Clicking on the button will bring you directly to the prospect\u2019s recent posts, which are summarized in the Sales Navigator window. Once redirected, you can like or comment on their posts.\n\nLinkedIn: Send a Message\nIf the sequence task included a template, you can click on the button next to the template text to copy the message that needs to be sent to the prospect. Variables that were included in the template will automatically fill out with the prospect\u2019s information, so you can easily copy and paste the message for delivery. Otherwise, compose your message to your prospect. Click on the \u201csend\u201d button, and a message will be sent directly to their InMail, as long as you have not hit your monthly InMail cap.\n\nLinkedIn: Send a Connection Request\nWhen you click into the LinkedIn task, you\u2019ll see a button on the task flow that says \u201cConnect in\u201d. Clicking on the button will bring you directly to the prospect\u2019s LinkedIn profile, where you can connect or view them in Sales Navigator. If a template was assigned to the template tasks, variables will automatically populate. You can easily copy and paste the template to include in the connection message.\n\n \n " .

Inherently, they are complex to build and because of the multitude of differences between the browsers they operate on, they can experience a wide range of issues. \nIf you are missing chrome extension features, please close and restart your chrome browser.\nTroubleshooting the Outreach Everywhere Chrome Extension\nHere are some tips to get started with troubleshooting these functionality issues:\n\nCheck that the extension is up-to-date in the Chrome settings\nCheck that the Chrome bowser itself is up-to-date in About Chrome\nTry hard-refreshing the browser - this clears the browser's cache for a specific page. The short cut for this is Command >> Shift >> R  (Mac) OR Ctrl >> F5 (PC);\nTry clearing the entire browser's cache - you can do this when clearing your browser history. Too much cache built up can cause application and extension related functionality issues.\nMake sure your mailbox is connected in Outreach (the send/sync toggle on and green).\n\nIf these functionality issues persist, it is worth checking other elements of the browser that may be interfering.\n\nAudit the other extensions you have running in the Chrome settings. We have seen issues in particular with the Salesforce IQ extensions and Persist IQ extensions causing interference with the Outreach extension. Unfortunately, in this situation there isn't anything that we can do to stop this interference. Our recommendation is to either remove the interfering extension, or operate them in separate Chrome profiles. \nEnsure that you're not running an old/slow browser or computer.\n\nIf issues persist beyond this, please reach out through our support portal." .

You can only choose one prospect role. \nOpportunity - The trigger actions will affect a field on the Opportunity itself, and will not affect any associated prospects.\nAccount - The trigger actions will apply to the associated account for this opportunity. \n\nNow that you\u2019ve selected the trigger event and target, you need to determine what conditions need to be met before the trigger will fire.  Conditions are built from fields that exist in Outreach. For Opportunity triggers specifically, you can add Account and Opportunity conditions. Examples include \u201cStage is Negotiation\u201d and \u201cProbability is Likely\u201d.\nFinally, you\u2019ll add trigger actions. The trigger action is the specific action the trigger takes when the trigger event and conditions are met. Triggers can be set up to fire only once per target by selecting the checkbox.  If the trigger action has already applied to the target, disabling and reenabling a trigger will not fire the trigger a second time. \nThere are 6 available actions that can take place when the trigger conditions are met. Not all trigger targets will appear - the trigger conditions are conditional based on the target you\u2019ve selected. For example, if you select \u201copportunity\u201d as the trigger target, you won\u2019t see the \u201cadd to sequence\u201d option.\n \n\nAdd Tag - Add a tag to the trigger target(s)\nRemove Tag - Remove a tag from the trigger target(s)\nAdd to Sequence - Add the trigger target(s) to a sequence. For example, sequence the primary prospect into the \u201cinitial meeting reminder\u201d sequence.\nCreate Task - Create a task. The task that is created depends on if you've selected an opportunity, account, or prospect as your target(s).\nSet Field - Set a field on the trigger target(s).\nStop Sequences - Mark all sequences, related sequences, or specific sequences as finished. A 'related sequence' is the sequence associated with the 'event' of the trigger. For example--if the trigger is: \"when a meeting is booked, stop the related sequence\", it will stop the sequence that sent out the meeting invite. The \"related sequence\" will be empty for many events, in which case, the trigger will be a no-op.\n\n \n \n " .

        _:115005650848 <header> "SPF and DKIM" .
        _:115005650848 <article> "There are a few technical steps you can take to keep your emails from being mistakenly filtered as spam. This article will examine two of them; SPF records and DKIM.\nWhat is SPF?\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework) records give a mail server information about where an email should be coming from to prevent spoofing.  When an email is received, the IP address of the sending mail server is embedded in the message, much like a postmark on an envelope contains the city it was sent from.  An SPF record lists the IP address or IP range that the legitimate email server uses; if a mail comes from somewhere that isn\u2019t listed in the SPF record, the incoming server can assume it was spoofed or otherwise illegitimate and reject it as spam.\nDo I have an SPF record for my email address?\nYou can find out if this is already set up by asking your domain or mail administrator, but you can also do a quick check yourself to see if this record already exists.  To do so, you can do a search for TXT records here:\nhttps://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/\nEnter just the domain from your email address in the box on this page.  For example, if your email address is gordon.schumway@outreach.io, you would enter just outreach.io in this box.  You\u2019ll get a result that looks like this:\n\nThe SPF record (if you have one) is the record that begins with \u201cv=spf1\u201d.  However, you won\u2019t know if this record is correct for your domain without checking with your email provider.  If you send mail from many different sources, this record could be quite complex, but the major email providers provide some information about the correct records for their services.  You can see the right records for Gmail here:\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/178723?hl=en&ref_topic=2759192\nYou can see the right records for Office 365 here:\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn789058(v=exchg.150).aspx\nHaving the wrong record can be worse than no record at all, so be sure that this has been updated if you\u2019ve recently changed email providers.\nHelp! My SPF record is incorrect or missing! How do I fix it?\nIf your SPF record is incorrect or missing, you\u2019ll need to update this in your domain\u2019s DNS records.  To do this, you\u2019ll need to check with your domain\u2019s DNS provider, which is most often the registrar where you purchased the domain.  Each provider will have different ways of entering this information, but they can all help in adding a TXT record to your domain containing the correct information.  Once you\u2019ve added or edited the record, it can sometimes take a few hours for the new record to propagate fully and be available to all mail servers.  Your DNS provider can give you more information about this.\nWhat is DKIM?\nDKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is the process of using public key cryptography to encrypt all or part of your email.  Your mail server will use a private key to encrypt the data and receiving email servers can get the corresponding public key to decrypt it, ensuring that your email is genuinely sent from your domain and hasn\u2019t been altered.  This will contribute positively toward your anti-spam score for mail providers that use this.\nAm I already using DKIM?\nThis is harder to check, as you would need to know the selector for your DKIM key and this could be anything chosen by your mail administrator.  If you have access to your domain\u2019s DNS records, you can see if you are already using DKIM by looking for a record that looks like:\nselector._domainkey 3600 IN TXT \u201cv=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=[lots of random looking symbols]\u201d\nWhere selector is the string chosen by your mail administrator to correspond with the DKIM policy activated by your mail service.  If you are already using DKIM, it\u2019s very important not to change any part of this record, as it needs to correctly correspond to your current mail policy.\nHow do I start using DKIM?\nMuch more so than SPF, this requires cooperation from your email provider, so the records and changes you might need to make will be specific to your provider.  You can find the instructions for Gmail here:\nhttps://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en&ref_topic=2752442\nYou can find instructions for Office 365 here:\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt695945(v=exchg.150).aspx\nIf you\u2019re using another provider, you\u2019ll need to work with your mail administrator in generating the keys and implementing the correct policy for DKIM for your service, in addition to providing the public key through adding a DNS record.  Note that incomplete or incorrect records can render your email undeliverable to your recipients, so be sure to follow instructions carefully!\nIf I use SPF and DKIM, am I guaranteed not to get blacklisted for spam?\nNot at all.  There is no guarantee that you won\u2019t be marked as spam by a receiving mail provider\u2019s spam filter.  These filters are dynamic and incorporate a variety of factors, including SPF and DKIM verification, an analysis of your message content, the reputation of your domain, and even the behavior of other users on the receiving domain.  With that said, SPF and DKIM are a significant part of this filtering that is completely under your control and using these technologies properly will give your messages the best chance of reaching their intended recipients.  If you\u2019re looking for a good way of testing your overall spam score (which will include many of these elements), you can try a service like https://www.mail-tester.com/ to get a good baseline.\nIf you have further questions about how SPF and DKIM relate to Outreach, feel free to reach out to us at support@outreach.io and we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions." .

Here\u2019s how: \n1. Open a New Meeting\nThere are a few areas within the Outreach platform where meetings can be scheduled with prospects (you can learn more here), but for this tutorial we\u2019ll start in the quick actions menu.\nClick the lightning bolt symbol on the top right corner of your Outreach window. From the dropdown window, select \"Meeting.\"\n \n2. Select Your Meeting Type\nChoose your meeting type from the dropdown menu. Your meeting type will automatically populate certain settings, like title, length, conference dial in links [location], and a pre-written agenda [description]. You can choose from a meeting type you\u2019ve created, or one shared by a teammate or manager.\n\n \n3. Choose a date and time\nSelect the date and time of your meeting, either by clicking into the calendar or entering the date and time in the designated field.\n \n4. Add attendees\nAdd your prospects, customers, and/or colleagues to the meeting just by typing their email! As you type, Outreach will suggest relevant matches for you.\n Pro tip: Adding an internal teammate? If you use Google Calendar, you can see their availability in Outreach Meetings -- even if they\u2019re not an Outreach user -- to optimize for their schedule!\n \n \n5. Send Your Meeting Invite\nJust click send -- it\u2019s as simple as that! If your prospect needs to reschedule, no problem. Every meeting contains a link for one-click rescheduling.\n " .

Our solution is to allow you to apply timezones to your prospect and sync it to or from the list of available fields in Salesforce if that field is in the correct format. If you are not syncing from Salesforce.com, we do allow you to assign timezone on import or in bulk once prospects already exist in the platform. \nSync Timezones from Salesforce\nIf you are syncing timezone information from Salesforce, it will need to be in an accepted format. We still prefer IANA Formatted Timezones, which are the only type that reliably include daylight savings time information (e.g. 'America/Los_Angeles'), and so we\u2019ve changed the label the user will see in the Salesforce field mapping to be \u201cTime Zone (IANA)\u201d.\nIf they do happen to sync a time zone format that we can\u2019t understand, we\u2019ll now just ignore that time zone field and continue to sync the record without error.\nIf you do sync over a format that is abbreviated: like PST or EST, we will allow that to sync. However, that abbreviation does not account for Daylight savings time, so we do not inherently change the prospects timezone at that time of year. If you are syncing from Salesforce.com but your timezone is in the abbreviated format, we recommend syncing that field into a custom field in Outreach and then creating a trigger to assign the correctly formatted IANA timezone, that will accommodate for daylight savings time. \nAttached is a list of Timezones that are accepted by the Outreach application, make sure to enter the text exactly as it appears in the attached CSV, other formats will not be accepted. \nAssign Prospect Timezones\nOne off changes can be made by going into the prospect profile and choosing from the Time Zone picklist. \n\n \nIf you're uploading in bulk, simply create a new column and include the appropriate IANA\n\nThen map it to the new Time Zone (IANA) field.\n " .

        _:205669747 <article> "Every sequence has steps that predetermine how and when a prospect should be engaged. There are a few sequence step options you can choose from when creating your sequences. \nAuto Email\nAuto emails help you reach more prospects with less effort. Your emails will automatically send out to prospects based on the time interval you set for each step.\nFor example, let\u2019s say your automatic email sends out individual touch points on days 1, 3, and 7. All you have to do is start your sequence, add the prospects into the sequence, and then your prospects will receive these emails with the specified templates on days 1, 3, and 7.\nManual Email\nManual emails are used for sending out customized emails. When a prospect enters a manual email step, a manual task will appear in your tasks tab once the prospect enters that step. This email task will be \u201cdue\u201d at the time interval you select for the step. The task will be completed when the email is sent and the prospect will progress to the next step.\nFor example, let\u2019s say the time interval is set for 3 days and the prospect just entered the manual email step. This task will show up in your tasks tab immediately, showing that the email is due 3 days from now. You can pre-populate these emails with templates, then customize them further when you send them.\nPhone Call\nPhone calls keep you accountable for following up with prospects via phone. Once a prospect enters this step, a call task will be created for you. When creating this step, you can add notes to leave yourself a reminder for why you are calling this prospect. Outreach will mark this task as completed, and the prospect will move on to the next step, once this call is logged.\nFor example, you can use a call task to remind yourself to call your prospect for an introduction call or to ask them clarifying questions.\nGeneric Task\nGeneric tasks are helpful reminders to complete an action outside of Outreach. This task will be created once your prospect enters the step, and will be due when the set time interval has passed. Your prospect will move on to the next step once you mark the task as complete.\nFor example, you could create a generic task to remind yourself to connect with a prospect on LinkedIn.\nLinkedIn \nLinkedIn Tasks are a key step type that many teams integrate into their daily workflows. These activities may include steps like: sending a connection request, viewing a profile, interacting with posted content (liking, commenting, or sharing), and sending a message through InMail." .
